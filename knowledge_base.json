  "summary": "The only child and son of James and Lily Potter (n\u00e9e Evans), Harry's birth was overshadowed by a prophecy, naming either himself or Neville Longbottom as the one with the power to vanquish Lord Voldemort. After half of the prophecy was reported to Voldemort, courtesy of Severus Snape, Harry was chosen as the target due to his many similarities with the Dark Lord. During this attempt, he murdered Harry's parents as they tried to protect him, but this unsuccessful attempt to kill Harry led to Voldemort's first downfall. This downfall marked the end of the First Wizarding War, and to Harry henceforth being known as \"The Boy Who Lived\", as he was the only known survivor of the Killing Curse. One consequence of Lily's loving sacrifice was that her orphaned son had to be raised by her only remaining blood relative, his Muggle aunt Petunia Dursley. While in her care, he would be protected from Lord Voldemort due to the Bond of Blood charm Albus Dumbledore placed upon him. This powerful charm would protect him until he became of age, or no longer called his aunt's house home. Due to Petunia's resentment of her sister and her magic gifts, Harry grew up abused and neglected. The Sorting Hat hat told Harry that he would do well in Slytherin House, but Harry pleaded 'not Slytherin' and the Hat heeded this plea, instead sorting the young wizard into Gryffindor House."

He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1989-1996 with Fred, and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. He and Fred were popular students, becoming Beaters for the Gryffindor Quidditch team in their second year, and members of Dumbledore's Army in their unfinished seventh year. A born prankster and inventor, George left Hogwarts prior to graduation to become a successful entrepreneur, alongside his twin brother, and opened the joke shop Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes at 93 Diagon Alley. He was a member of the Order of the Phoenix and fought in the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts; in the latter, Fred died, leaving George devastated. Sometime after the end of the Second Wizarding war, George married Angelina Johnson, with whom he had a son named Fred, in honour of his late twin, and a daughter named Roxanne. George Weasley was appropriately born 1 April, 1978, April Fool's Day, as he and his brother Fred were mischievous pranksters. He and Fred were younger than siblings Bill, Charlie, and Percy, and older than siblings Ron and Ginny. George and Fred were troublemakers from a young age, delighting in playing clever pranks and in teasing their siblings (especially Percy), and it was a challenge for their mother to try to keep them under control."

In 2020, Diggory's participation in the Triwizard Tournament and subsequent death was the subject of Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy's time-travel antics at the request of Amos. They sought to save Cedric and created an alternate timeline where Cedric survived and became part of the Death Eaters, because of the humiliation they caused him when they tried to save his life.

The Leaky Cauldron was present long before Charing Cross Road was even planned in the nineteenth century; its true address was number one, Diagon Alley, and it was believed to have been built some time in the early 1500s, along with the rest of the wizarding street. It was a popular historical theory that the second oldest building in Diagon Alley was Gringotts Wizarding Bank and that the other shops grew up around it. The then Minister for Magic, Ulick Gamp, agreed to give the landlord of the day present at the Leaky Cauldron responsibility for letting people into Diagon Alley from his back yard. In 1926, one of the shops in Diagon Alley was burgled with the help of a Four-Headed Bird. Harry Potter's first visit to Diagon Alley with Rubeus Hagrid marked his re-introduction to the wizarding world. Harry's first stop was Gringotts Wizarding Bank, where he encountered Goblins for the first time."

  "summary": "The Golden Snitch, often simply called the Snitch, is the third and smallest ball used in Quidditch. The Seeker's goal is to catch the Snitch before the other team's seeker, which is worth one-hundred and fifty points. The game can only end when the Snitch has been caught, or by mutual agreement of the two teams' Captains; the latter is very rare, however, as one team would have to lose. The Quidditch rule also stated that only the two team's Seeker has the right to catch (or touch) the Snitch, any player other than the Seeker to do so commits a foul called a Snitchnip. The Golden Snitch was originally not a ball, but a little magical bird called a Golden Snidget. It was introduced in 1269, when the Chief of the Wizards' Council, Barberus Bragge, unleashed a Golden Snidget during a Quidditch match, offering a reward of 150 Galleons to the player who caught the Snidget. This Snidget-catching craze naturally harmed the bird's population (as Snidgets are very fragile birds, and a simple human grip is enough to crush them to death), but the wizarding community was then unwilling to stop this barbaric activity and ceased to use Snidgets only when the bird was labelled as endangered. A replacement for the Golden Snidget was sought, and the skilled metal-charmer Bowman Wright invented the Golden Snitch to replace it. The Snitch weighed exactly the same as a Snidget, and its rotational wings imitated the bird's, allowing it to change direction and speed like its living counterpart. One tale concerning the Snitch is that, during a match on Bodmin Moor in 1884, it managed to avoid capture for six months until both teams finally gave up in disgust at the performance of their Seekers."

Brennan Doyle was a Keeper of the Ravenclaw Quidditch team, but got down to the substitute roster when Andre Egwu joined the team. During the match, Beater Erika Rath, from the team opposing Skye's team, sent a Bludger towards Jacob's sibling, who was in the audience. As this was only a practise match, the victory or loss of the Ravenclaw Quidditch team did not affect the Quidditch Cup. When Ravenclaw played the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Gryffindor was missing their Seeker, Harry Potter, who was unconscious in the hospital wing during the game. It is most likely that either Ravenclaw or Slytherin won the Quidditch Cup - although implied that Slytherin were the victors (given the supposed importance of the Quidditch cup to the general House standings, and Slytherin's apparently huge lead): which suggests that Ravenclaw must have previously lost not only to Slytherin (otherwise Slytherin could not have been the winners) but to Hufflepuff as well. Otherwise, the record-breaking victory over Gryffindor would have given them the advantage over both Slytherin and Gryffindor in points difference, with three teams tied on 2 wins / 1 loss. Although they beat Hufflepuff by 130 points, Ravenclaw's Quidditch Cup campaign was cut short due to the attacks on Muggle-born students and the reopening of the Chamber of Secrets."

Thestrals were, undeservedly, known as omens of misfortune and aggression by many wizards because they were visible only to those who had witnessed death at least once or due to their somewhat grim, gaunt and ghostly appearance. Due to Thestrals' classification as XXXX, only experienced wizards should try to handle Thestrals. Breeding as well as owning these beasts might be discouraged or even illegal without Ministry consent; in fact, wizards that lived in areas not protected against Muggles were forced by law to perform Disillusionment Charms on their Thestrals regularly. This was because they were seen as having big, bony figures and their dragon-like faces which bore white, glittering eyes that lacked both expression and pupils. Being a type of winged horse, most of their anatomy was identical to a horse, excluding their large wings that sprouted from their back. Unlike the Abraxan, another breed of winged horses, Thestral's wings did not possess any feathers at all; they had vast, black and leathery wings that were more similar to those of bats. These eerie horses had long black manes, as well as a large tail, either with flowing black hair, like horses or ending in a tuft, like zebras."

In the late 19th century, the conditions on the relatively impoverished neighbourhoods of London worsened: robbery, violence, prostitution, social disturbance and alcohol dependency were commonplace. Around the same time, a Boggart, popularly known as the Bludgeoning Boggart of Old London Town, prowled the back streets of London and, feeding on people's fears, took on the form of a \"murderous thug\", before having been reduced to a hamster with one simple incantation \u2014 these two seem to account for the \"serial killer\" that Muggles dubbed \"Jack the Ripper\".

Some classes, including the core classes, might be dropped in sixth year. Even though students couldn't apply for Time-Turners to take more classes than were able to fit in the timetables, a student's head of house might suggest a Time-Turner to an individual on very rare occasions. All students did, however, have a choice to drop a course if they became a burden (aside from the essential classes). All first-years at Hogwarts must take seven core subjects: Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, History of Magic, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Astronomy and Herbology. At the end of their second year at Hogwarts, students were required to choose a minimum of two additional subjects from the following list: Arithmancy, Muggle Studies, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes and Care of Magical Creatures. Students couldn't elect to drop any of the core subjects at this time, but they might choose to drop an elective if it became a burden. During fifth year students had an appointment with their head of house to discuss which job they would like to go into, the teacher would recommend any specific subjects for N.E.W.T."

During Harry Potter's first flying lesson, Madam Hooch had to leave the class unattended when Neville Longbottom crashed and fell from his broomstick. Harry followed Malfoy on his broomstick, and although he had never flown before, he was able to control the broom with ease and managed to catch the Remembrall in a 50 foot dive when Malfoy threw it. Professor McGonagall witnessed the catch, and instead of punishing Harry for not staying on the ground as Madam Hooch had ordered, she offered him the place of Seeker in the Gryffindor Quidditch team. During the 2017\u20132018 school year, when Madam Hooch was teaching first years how to summon their brooms, students such as Yann Fredericks and Rose Granger-Weasley were highly successful with mastering broom summoning, however, Albus Potter, Harry Potter's son, failed to summon his broom, much to his humiliation. The course aimed of these lessons were largely aimed towards providing students with a basic understanding of the only the most elementary principles behind the study of broomology, which was to say, both how to handle a broom and progressively work on various techniques and manoeuvres performed while in flight, as well as receiving proper instructions on the subject of proper broom care and maintenance."

The term Sir or Madam (depending on the gender) was an alternative title to use instead of Professor, on the speaker's preference. Hogwarts Professors had the power to award and dock points (to determine the winner of the house cup competition), give detention, and write notes for certain areas and activities that were usually off limits. For example, they could grant permission for students access the Restricted Section in the Hogwarts Library or permission to practise on the Quidditch pitch at specific times, even if another team was scheduled. Professors could put students in detention, but couldn't expel them without the approval of the Headmaster. For example, Bartemius Crouch Junior (posing as Alastor Moody) was reprimanded by Minerva McGonagall for turning Draco Malfoy into a ferret, while serving as Defence Against the Dark Arts professor in 1994."

To Muggles, the school appeared to be an old, abandoned castle.

Established around the 10th century, Hogwarts was considered to be one of the finest magical institutions in the wizarding world, though other notable schools included Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in France, the Durmstrang Institute implied to be in northern Europe, and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the United States. However, if the child in question was a Muggle-born or a half-blood like Harry Potter with no knowledge of the wizarding world, a staff member from the school visited the child and his or her family in order to inform them of their magical heritage and the existence of the wizarding world. The school's motto was Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus (Draco Dormiens Nvnqvam Titillandvs), which, translated from Latin, means \"Never tickle a sleeping dragon\". Hogwarts School, located somewhere in the Highlands of Scotland, consisted of the large Hogwarts Castle and extensive school grounds surrounding it, which included sloping lawns, flowerbeds, vegetable patches, as well as a loch (called the Black Lake), a large dense forest (called the Forbidden Forest), several greenhouses and other outbuildings, and a full-size Quidditch Pitch.

The Gryffindor house emphasised the traits of courage as well as \"daring, nerve, and chivalry\", and thus its members were generally regarded as brave, though sometimes to the point of recklessness. Notably, Gryffindor house contributed many members to Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix, although this may have been because the main members made it a point not to associate with other houses. According to Phineas Nigellus Black, members of other houses, particularly Slytherin, sometimes felt that Gryffindors engaged in \"pointless heroics\". Another Slytherin, Severus Snape, considered many Gryffindors to be self-righteous and arrogant, with no regard for rules. Gryffindors and Slytherins had shared a fierce house rivalry since their founders, Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin, respectively, had a severe falling out over Slytherin's emphasis on blood purity. There might also be an element of feeling wronged, as Harry and his fellow Gryffindors tended to win in a lot of circumstances which, when viewed from a neutral point of view, may be considered unfair. Examples of this included the last-minute points awarded by Headmaster Dumbledore at the End-of-Term Feast, which conveniently put Gryffindor ten points ahead of Slytherin in the 1991\u20131992 school year, the fact that no points were deducted for the rule breaking that happened during that night and Harry being permitted by Professor McGonagall to have his own broomstick for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, even though first-years were not normally permitted their own broomsticks because of danger. Members of other houses might have felt that Gryffindor received favouritism, considering that many saw Harry Potter being chosen as the fourth competitor in the Triwizard Tournament as an unfair stealing of Hufflepuff student Cedric Diggory's thunder."

The group was disbanded during the 1996\u20131997 school year following the appointment of Severus Snape as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, although several members heeded the call and participated in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower at the end of the year. It was restarted by Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood during the 1997\u20131998 school year after Hogwarts fell under the control of Lord Voldemort in order to oppose Death Eater professors Alecto and Amycus Carrow, who spread propaganda against Muggles and Muggle-borns and taught the Dark Arts. Dumbledore's Army played a vital role during the Second Wizarding War, and members of the organisation fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, and the Battle of Hogwarts. Shortly after their fifth Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson during their fifth year, it soon became clear to Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger that practical defensive magic would not be taught in the class. Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge was afraid that Albus Dumbledore could use practical lessons to train an army of wizards and witches to oppose him and to try to take over the Ministry, since he refused to believe that Lord Voldemort had returned. Concerned that they needed defensive magical skills to combat Voldemort and his Death Eaters, Hermione proposed the formation of a practical study group to be taught by Harry as he had more experience than any of them with using actual defensive and offensive magic following his encounters with Voldemort.

Lockhart and Snape opened the club with a demonstration of formal duelling, including the accepted combative position, though Snape was rather crude with his greeting. Snape easily overpowered Lockhart, hitting him with a Disarming Charm so powerful that it knocked Lockhart against the nearby wall. Presumably deciding that Snape was far too skilful for him, Lockhart barely covered his own ineptitude by lying that he let Snape do it (which angered Snape so much that even the ever ignorant Lockhart saw it) and decided to let the students practise duelling on their own. The students were split into pairs (with Snape making sure neither Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, nor Hermione Granger were partnered with each other) and commanded to practise disarming. This, however, turned out to be a mistake, as the room quickly dissolved into chaos, and had to be broken up by the use of Finite Incantatem by Snape. Some results of the frenzied duelling included Harry and Draco Malfoy using far more malicious spells than the Disarming Charm, Ron's broken wand leaving Seamus Finnigan ashen-faced, and Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode reduced to physical combat. At this, Snape suggested teaching the students to block unfriendly spells would be prudent. At Snape's instruction, Draco used the Snake Summons Spell and conjured a large, black snake."

They passed through solid objects without damaging themselves or the material, but created disturbances in water, fire and air. Muggles cannot become ghosts, nor can they see ghosts clearly. In some instances, animals might also become ghosts upon death. A ghost was the transparent, three-dimensional imprint of a deceased witch or wizard, which continued to exist in the mortal world. Muggles cannot come back as ghosts, and the wisest witches and wizards chose not to. It was those with \"unfinished business\", whether in the form of fear, guilt, regrets or overt attachment to the material world who refused to move on to the next dimension. As a result, ghosts knew nothing about the afterlife and some later came to regret that they became ghosts instead of moving on. Having chosen a feeble simulacrum of mortal life, ghosts were limited in what they could experience. No physical pleasure remained to them, and their knowledge and outlook remained at the level it had attained during life, so that old resentments (for instance, at having an incompletely severed neck) continued to rankle after several centuries."

Ravenclaw House prized learning, wisdom, wit, and intellect in its members. Thus, many Ravenclaws tended to be academically motivated and talented students. Hermione Granger, an extremely intelligent witch and the top student in her year, was sorted into Gryffindor, though she admitted that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered placing her in Ravenclaw. Often hard-working and diligent, as often was the case with intellectuals with a predisposition for academics, some of the pupils sorted under the blue-bronzed eagle were known to be inclined to dismiss certain social expectations for the sake of satisfying their own intellectual curiosity. Luna Lovegood, for example, was one such student: eccentric to put it at its mildest, she was a Ravenclaw student who initially was bullied for her open defiance of conventionality, but ultimately became a celebrated wizarding naturalist and renowned for her participation in the legendary Battle of Hogwarts and past membership in Dumbledore's Army."

  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts",
  "summary": "It took place in the early hours of 2 May, 1998, within the castle and on the grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the mountainous region of Scotland. When the Dark Wizard Lord Voldemort learned that his archenemy Harry Potter had secretly ventured into the castle to locate and destroy one of his final Horcruxes, he ordered every single Death Eater and dark creature that had ever pledged loyalty to him to launch a massive attack on the school. Dumbledore's Army then communicated the need to fight to the Order of the Phoenix and their other allies within the British Ministry of Magic, leading to a large-scale battle. Voldemort led his forces from the Shrieking Shack in Hogsmeade; while Harry Potter, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Minerva McGonagall led the defenders of Hogwarts. The battle ended with a decisive victory for the Order and the D.A., with many Death Eaters and Voldemort himself dead. It was the most devastating battle of the war, with casualties including: Lord Voldemort, Bellatrix Lestrange, Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Severus Snape, Fred Weasley, Colin Creevey, Lavender Brown, and at least fifty more who fought against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. It is also assumed to be the final conflict in which the Elder Wand took part, due to it being resealed in Albus Dumbledore's tomb after the battle. On 1 August, 1997, Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour was secretly captured by Voldemort and interrogated for the whereabouts of Harry Potter. However, in one last brave act for Harry, Scrimgeour told Voldemort nothing, and was murdered by the Dark Lord as a result. This easily placed the Ministry of Magic under the secret influential control of Voldemort and his Death Eaters, who quickly replaced Scrimgeour with Pius Thicknesse, a corrupt politician under the Imperius Curse and a puppet of Voldemort. Hogwarts also quickly fell under Voldemort's influence, and he appointed Severus Snape as the new Headmaster (interestingly, Snape had killed the previous headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, just a month before)."

  "summary": "The Captain of a Quidditch team might call for \"time-out\" during a match, end a match should Captains of both playing teams gave mutual consent, and at Hogwarts use the Prefects' Bathroom. Unlike prefects being firmly chosen from only the fifth-year students and above of each house, the exact requirement and restriction for choosing team captains is unknown, seeing as captains of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, Oliver Wood was appointed in either his fourth year or fifth year, Angelina Johnson in her seventh year, and Harry Potter in his sixth year, thus an age requirement might not have existed. It is however proven that Quidditch captaincy was not a simple matter of seniority on the team, as shown in the case of Harry Potter being made captain, while a member of his team, Katie Bell, was a year older than him. When a Quidditch team member was appointed as Captain, they would retain their previous position (either Beater, Chaser, Keeper or Seeker) as well as assuming their additional responsibilities: Being required to hold Quidditch trials, plan training sessions and organise their House teams, and also responsible for almost anything regarding their House team activities and members. Captains were given status similarly equal to that of prefects, being given a silver badge to wear on their school uniform or on their Quidditch robes during matches or practising, and were allowed to use the Prefects' Bathroom."

In 1995, Smith joined Dumbledore's Army after hearing his house-mates, Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott, discussing it; part of his motivation seems to have been curiosity as to how Cedric Diggory was murdered at the end of the previous school year. Smith was also openly critical of Harry Potter's leadership abilities, such as when he scoffed at Harry's decision to teach them Expelliarmus, which prompted Harry to point out that it had saved him when he duelled with Lord Voldemort, and that Zacharias was free to leave at any time. He also  openly mocked Harry when he believed him to be taking remedial Potions, due to Harry's private lessons with Severus Snape to learn Occlumency.

This rises to a climax where thunderous clusters of timpani and hair-raising choir are introduced only to die back down, followed by an atmospheric flutter from the harp. The strings then lead into another extremity which uses bits and pieces from John Williams' \"The Patronus Light\", interjected by harsh, grating brass.

  "summary": "Pure-blood was the term for wizarding families who claimed to have no Muggles or Muggle-borns in their family tree; however, when traced back far enough, nearly every family tree had some non-magical ancestors. Most pure-blood families were related by then in an effort, by some, to retain their status by marrying only other pure-blood families, but it had eventually led to inbreeding. While some families, such as the Malfoys, had allowed for marrying half-bloods, others such as the Gaunts, Lestranges, and Blacks, required their family to only marry pure-blood individuals, or those with no Muggle or Muggle-born ancestors. Traditionalist pure-bloods liked to keep the generations \"pure\" by breeding with other pure-bloods and were generally the ones who used the term \"Mudblood\", a term considered derogatory by the wizarding world. Families of pure-blood status often avoided marrying their heirs off to Muggle-Borns and half-bloods, believing that the next generation could lose their capability to perform magic. In the 1930s, a wizard, commonly believed to be Cantankerus Nott, wrote the Pure-Blood Directory featuring twenty-eight families he believed to be truly pure-blooded, though many objected to this designation. Some pure-blood families could trace their pure-blood status through many generations of magical ancestors and deny ever having any Muggles within the family, such as the House of Black, the motto of which is \"Toujours pur\", meaning \"Always (or Still) Pure\"."

Despite their magical ability, pure-blood supremacists were prone to be very hostile towards both Muggle-borns, as well as those that were accepting of them, fearing that the promotion and acceptance of the the mixture of magical and non-magical blood would dilute or even negate the wizard identity. They viewed Muggles, Muggle-borns, half-bloods, half-breeds with contempt and considered the Muggle world to be inferior to their own. Pure-bloods, and even half-bloods, who do not share this view are considered traitors to their own kind or \"blood traitors\". Elitist pure-bloods even believed that it was a sign of weak magic to enjoy non-magical company and seemed to believe that some of the supposed dirtiness of Muggles and Muggle-borns would rub off on those who associated with them, thus they considered blood traitors to be \"filthy\" as well. Bellatrix Lestrange, for example, claimed that \"blood traitor is next to Mudblood in  book\", and her family often disowned and blasted off the family tree any members who could be considered blood traitors. Blood traitors might also be shunned by their families and acquaintances: for example, Bellatrix and her younger sister Narcissa Malfoy stopped seeing their sister Andromeda after she married a Muggle-born wizard, Ted Tonks."

The only child and son of Tom and Merope Riddle (n\u00e9e Gaunt), Riddle was raised in the Muggle-run Wool's Orphanage after his father abandoned his new family on the streets of London when the influence of her magic was lifted, and his mother died moments after giving birth to and naming him after his father and maternal grandfather, Marvolo Gaunt. Some of his early activities included the opening of Salazar Slytherin's Chamber of Secrets and the use of its monster to attack Muggle-born students, several months' service as a purchasing agent for the Dark artefacts shop Borgin and Burkes, use of the ability to speak Parseltongue, and the attainment of immortality between the years of 1943 and 1998, a process begun upon the creation of his first Horcrux at the age of sixteen. He commanded a veritable army of wizards and Dark creatures, committed countless murders and atrocities personally and through his followers, and on one occasion nearly succeeded and on a later occasion did succeed in taking over the Ministry of Magic, installing a puppet Minister, Pius Thicknesse, who was controlled with the Imperius Curse.

When Voldemort touched one of them, each of the Death Eaters felt it, signalling for them to Apparate to their leader's side. Before the Death Eaters themselves came to be, Tom Riddle, as Voldemort was known in his childhood and early adulthood, gathered a gang of Slytherin students who considered themselves his friends, though in truth, he felt no real attachments to any of them due to his lack of desire for a true friend. According to former Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, they were a mixture of the weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking glory, and the thuggish seeking a leader who could show them more refined cruelty, and were considered to be forerunners of the Death Eaters since most (if not all) indeed became the first Death Eaters. He manipulated them to do his bidding, and though this led to several nasty incidents over the years, with Riddle's strategic discretion, none was linked back to the group, much less the model student Riddle himself.

  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/File:Severus_Snape.jpg",
  "summary": "Slytherin was one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Salazar Slytherin. In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the Sorting Hat to pick students who had a few particular characteristics he most valued. Many Slytherin students tended to clique together, often acquiring leaders, which further exemplified Slytherin's ambitious qualities. Examples of these included Draco Malfoy's gang, Merula Snyde's gang, Pansy Parkinson's gang and the Death Eaters. There were two notable heads of the house; Horace Slughorn took the role twice (first leaving in 1981 and then taking the role again from 1997 until leaving before 2016), and Severus Snape. Slytherin corresponded roughly with the element of water due to serpents being commonly associated with the sea and lochs in western European mythology, as well as serpents being physically fluid and flexible animals. Similarly, in Celtic mythology, water is seen as a portal to another world, leading some to speculate that the element was chosen to symbolise many Slytherins' hope for a pure-blood only community. The colours also corresponded with waters around lakes and lochs often being green, and silver being often associated with grey rainwater. Slytherin's opposition over the idea to allow witches and wizards from Half-blood and Muggle-born heritage to enrol at Hogwarts during its foundation created great controversy at the school and it was the root of a feud between former friends Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor."

  "summary": "By the 1990s, half-bloods were the most common type of wizard or witch, as the pure-blood wizarding population would have become extinct had they not inter-married with Muggles and Muggle-borns. It should be noted that any wizard or witch who was neither pure-blood nor Muggle-born was considered half-blood, even if they had two magical parents; they need not have had exactly half-Muggle/half-wizard heritage. Magical children born to a Muggle-born and a Muggle are also considered half-bloods, such as Penny and Beatrice Haywood. Those who believed in the importance of blood purity considered half-bloods to be inferior because of their Muggle heritage, though superior to Muggle-borns. Members of these families were more likely to use \"half-blood\" in a derogatory manner, similar to the epithet \"Mudblood\"; Bellatrix Lestrange did so on multiple occasions, and the portrait of Walburga Black often equated half-bloods with Half-breeds. Some half-bloods expressed prejudice towards those with Muggle heritage, despite having some themselves, and clung to what wizarding heritage they had. Notably Lord Voldemort persecuted Muggles and Muggle-borns, despite the fact that his mother (Merope Gaunt) was a pure-blood witch and his father (Tom Riddle Snr) was a Muggle."

The Doxy was covered in coarse black hair, and had an additional set of arms and legs. Doxies had shiny beetle-like wings, and a double row of sharp teeth. Doxies buried their eggs underground, and Doxy Queens can lay up to five-hundred at once. Preferring cold climates, the Doxy was found throughout Northern Europe and North America. Alternatively, they can be dispatched with a simple Knockback Jinx, as doxies were particularly vulnerable to it, excluding the queens, which were more resistant. During the 1989\u20131990 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Silvanus Kettleburn taught his sixth-year Care of Magical Creatures students about Doxies. The same year, Doxies were involved in one of the obstacles of the All-Wizard Tournament, which was designed by Kettleburn. After gaining control of a broomstick jinxed with a Hurling Hex, the participants had to use it to catch a released Doxie. Unfortunately, a cage full of additional Doxies was knocked over during the task, resulting in several participants and spectators being sent to the Hospital Wing with Doxy bites."

In 1992, shortly after the end of his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the first film, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) spends a dreadful summer at the Dursleys' house without being allowed to use magic outside of school nor receiving any letters from his new friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), both of whom he is unable to contact because neither his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) nor Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) would allow their nephew's pet owl Hedwig out of her padlocked cage. On the evening of his twelfth birthday (July 31), he is visited in his room and warned that he will be in mortal danger if he returns to Hogwarts by a house-elf named Dobby (Toby Jones), who reveals that he has intercepted all of the letters to make it seem as though Harry's friends had forgotten him, hoping that it will then dissuade Harry from returning. But Harry ignores the warning and is determined to seize the letters, so Dobby, seeing that he will have to use force, heads downstairs and destroys a large cake that Petunia has baked for an important dinner party which Vernon is holding downstairs for the family of his client Mr Mason (Jim Norton) by the use of a Hover Charm, dropping it on Mrs Mason's (Veronica Clifford) head. The next night, Ron and his older brothers Fred and George (James and Oliver Phelps), come to Harry's rescue in an enchanted Ford Anglia belonging to their father, Head of the Ministry of Magic's Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams). After a pleasant stay together in the Weasley home, the Burrow, Harry accompanies the family on a trip through the Floo Network to buy some first year school supplies for Ron's younger sister Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) in Diagon Alley, where they encounter Hermione and Hogwarts half-giant gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) while attending a book signing at Flourish and Blotts for flamboyant celebrity author Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), who is recently appointed to teach at Hogwarts as the school's new Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor. After the signing, the trio run into their school rival Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and his father, chief Hogwarts governor Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), who manages to slip a diary into Ginny's belongings while arguing with Mr Weasley about the latter's recent Muggle Protection Act for the Ministry. As a loophole, however, the two boys instead fly to Hogwarts in the Ford Anglia, which unfortunately runs out of fuel for its Invisibility Booster when it catches up to the train (allowing the \"flying car\" to be seen by numerous Muggles) and crashes into the Whomping Willow on the school grounds."

  "summary": "The Triwizard Tournament was a magical contest held between the three largest wizarding schools of Europe: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Durmstrang Institute, and Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, each school being represented by one champion. Selected champions compete in three tasks \u2014 traditionally judged by the Headmasters or Headmistresses of the competing schools \u2014 designed to test magical ability, intelligence, and courage. The Tournament was notorious for being extremely dangerous: many champions died while competing, and it was discontinued at some point in or after 1792, due to the high death toll. The 1994 Triwizard Tournament is famous for having had four competing champions instead of three,  and for also having ended in tragedy with the death of Cedric Diggory and for the Rebirth of Lord Voldemort. The Triwizard Tournament was established approximately seven-hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the wizarding schools the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, and the Durmstrang Institute. Held every five years, the competition would be hosted by each school in turn, the judges for the Tournament comprising the headmasters or headmistresses of the schools. Due to the risks involved in overcoming the extremely dangerous tasks, and an increasing number of deaths, the Tournament was eventually discontinued at some point in or after the 1790s. Multiple attempts had been made to revive the Tournament, but none succeeded until the 1994\u20131995 school year, when it was held at Hogwarts Castle. Despite a new set of rules imposed to prevent any more deaths, a champion nevertheless died at the end, though this only occurred due to the tournament being sabotaged."

This made them similar to the forwards in football, as the game was generally started with the referee releasing the Quaffle into the air for the Chasers to try and claim possession of. The Chaser was the oldest position in the game of Quidditch, as the purpose of the game once consisted solely of scoring goals. The one major change to the role of the Chaser was in 1884 when the rules were changed that allowed only one Chaser into the scoring area while trying to score a goal. Chaser moves in the modern game of Quidditch included: Hawkshead Attacking Formation, Parkin's Pincer, Porskoff Ploy, and Reverse Pass. Chasers were generally considered the most exhilarating to watch by spectators during a Quidditch game, at least until the Golden Snitch had been spotted."

Water could be found in large amounts in lakes, such as the Black Lake, or in oceans, in which it takes the form of salt water, water with a heavy concentration of salt. In the wizarding world, water had a number of applications, such as its use in potions, the preferred form being standard potioning water. It could be conjured at will using magic, by using either the Water-Making Spell (Aguamenti) or Aqua Eructo. Lethe River Water was a special type of water with magical properties, collected from the Lethe, which was used as an ingredient in the Forgetfulness Potion, as it had memory loss properties. Humans can normally not survive underwater, as gills are required to breathe in water, but wizards could survive using charms such as the Bubble-Head Charm, or magical plants like Gillyweed. The cry of the Augurey was once believed to signify impending death, but it was later discovered by Gulliver Pokeby that it merely signalled the coming of rain, liquid water falling from the sky. Water can be used to extinguish most normal fires, although Fiendfyre was resistant to it, due to the potent nature of this curse.

The lake was often said to be very cold, but Viktor Krum was known to have swam in it, wearing nothing but swimming trunks, apparently not affected by the low temperature (although this was probably due to the fact that his school, Durmstrang, was located in a place that was even colder). Lily Evans and her school friends were also said to dangle their legs over the water, which could mean that there were no rules whilst they were in school against swimming in the lake. Every school year at Hogwarts, after the Hogwarts Express arrived at Hogsmeade station, Rubeus Hagrid (or a substitute) called the first-year students to follow him to the lake shore and the Hogwarts boats. At the start of the 1994\u20131995 school year, first-year Dennis Creevey said he fell into the lake and the Giant Squid pushed him back into a boat.

When heading back to the common room, he fell through a trick step in the staircase and dropped the egg, after seeing \"Bartemius Crouch\" on the Marauder's Map, which he assumed to be Barty Crouch Snr. Caretaker Argus Filch found the egg and, because Harry was under his Invisibility cloak, assumed that Peeves had stolen it. The egg was returned to Harry after \"Professor Moody\", who was really Barty Crouch Jr, secured the egg from Filch."

  "summary": "In 1992, Gilderoy Lockhart attempted to mend Harry Potter's broken arm after a Quidditch match with the healing spell Brackium Emendo; however his incompetence meant he ending up vanishing Harry's arm bones instead of mending them. Later that year, Severus Snape used the Snake-Vanishing Spell to vanish a snake that Draco Malfoy had conjured for Harry Potter during the Duelling Club. Professor Minerva McGonagall introduced Vanishment to her class in the form of the Vanishing Spell in her very first Transfiguration class with the fifth year students in 1995, giving them a lecture and then having them practice vanishing snails. When none of the students, except Hermione Granger, could perform the spell properly, Professor McGonagall told the students to practise the spell overnight, for a fresh start the next day. In their second lesson, the students were given questions on the Vanishing Spell for homework. On the 6th, however, the students were given a break from this spell and instead were given a long and difficult essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus Spell. Later on in the year, Professor McGonagall returned the class to Vanishing Spells, this time working to make mice disappear."

Having existed since at least 1294, Durmstrang was one of the three schools that competed in the Triwizard Tournament, and was notorious for prominently featuring the Dark Arts in its curriculum. Durmstrang did not admit Muggle-borns, but certain students might not necessarily have shared this prejudice - in 1994, Viktor Krum attended the Yule Ball with Hermione Granger, who was Muggle-born and would not have been admitted at Durmstrang. Durmstrang, like Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, was a castle, though their castle was not quite as big as Hogwarts Castle. In addition, the school was Unplottable; Durmstrang concealed its whereabouts from plain sight. Durmstrang was founded during the Middle Ages by the great Bulgarian witch Nerida Vulchanova, who served as the first head of the school. She was succeeded after her mysterious death by Professor Harfang Munter, who established Durmstrang's reputation for emphasising martial magic and duelling as an impressive part of its curriculum. Around 1294, the Triwizard Tournament was established as a friendly competition between Durmstrang Institute, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and Beauxbatons Academy of Magic."

The Chamber of Secrets never appeared on the map either because the creators never knew of it or it was unplottable as well, since when Ron and Hermione were in it collecting basilisk fangs, they did not appear on the map similar to the Room of Requirement. The Marauder's Map was created by Remus Lupin (Moony), Peter Pettigrew (Wormtail), Sirius Black III (Padfoot), and James Potter I (Prongs) while they were attending Hogwarts. The creation of the map started by 1974 and was finished between 1975 and 1978, because the titles on the map refer to the nicknames of these men in their Animagus forms, and, in Lupin's case, werewolf form. The four created the map via the usage of the Homonculous Charm, a powerful and advanced charm that enchanted the map to track the movements of everyone in the castle, as well as a charm to insult Severus Snape. The interior of the castle, meanwhile, was mapped over time with the help of James's Invisibility cloak. Although the precise circumstances surrounding the makers' loss of their map is mostly unknown, it is easy to conclude that they eventually over-reached themselves and were cornered by Filch, probably on a tip-off from Snape, whose obsession it had become to expose his arch-rival, James Potter, in wrongdoing. The masterpiece of a map was confiscated in Sirius, James, Remus and Peter's final year and none of them were able to steal it back from a well-prepared and suspicious Filch."

The Dementors of Azkaban were under the employ of the Ministry until mid-1996, when Lord Voldemort was sighted in the Ministry, and their defection to the Dark Lord's cause became undeniable. After the end of the Second Wizarding War in 1998, the Ministry was re-formed, and newly-appointed Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt ensured that they were not used by the government again, presumably due to their changing allegiance and support of Voldemort, and due to ethical reforms in the Ministry and Wizarding society at large. Perhaps its first resident, or even creator, Ekrizdis, practised the worst kinds of Dark Arts and constructed a fortress on the island, luring Muggle sailors there to torture and murder them. After his death, the various concealment charms placed on the island faded, and the Ministry became aware of the mysterious site's existence.

The Squad was also meant to help repress the rebellious activities of students who disagreed with the Ministry's claim that Lord Voldemort had not returned, and who instead supported Dumbledore and Harry Potter. Umbridge used many of the students who would become the Inquisitorial Squad to catch Dumbledore's Army members as they fled the Room of Requirement, with Malfoy catching Harry and receiving fifty house points, and Pansy Parkinson snatching up the list of members. The Inquisitorial Squad were among the very few in the school to side with her, working with her against their fellow students, but this became tantamount to painting targets on their backs. At least two of its members found themselves hexed by unknown students; Pansy Parkinson with one that caused her to sprout antlers and Cassius Warrington, who reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look like he was coated in cornflakes. Later, the Inquisitorial Squad helped Umbridge hold Harry, Hermione, Ron, Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood in her office for questioning after they were caught trying to use the Floo Network to contact Sirius Black.

If you're not, Prisoner of Azkaban recounts Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a year that is dogged by the feared criminal Sirius Black. Black, the eponymous escaped prisoner, was somehow involved in the death of Harry's parents and he is making great efforts to reach and presumably kill young Potter as well. As with all the stories in the Harry Potter series, this one has more twists and surprises than you can shake a stick at, so if you don't already know what's going to happen, you'll be in for some surprises. The game's story works pretty well, but it's better experienced as a companion to the book or movie, rather than as a standalone narrative. The gameplay in Prisoner of Azkaban has been expanded upon from previous Harry Potter games, primarily because you can now play as not only Harry but also his best friends, Ron and Hermione. The game's basic control scheme lets you map two spells to your action buttons, and a lock-on ability lets you dodge and keep your aim focused on a particular enemy or item of interest. The Entrance Hall and Grand Staircase appear much of the same as in their predecessing appearances in this game adaptation, though the Grounds appear to be an amalgamation of parts from Chamber of Secrets' exterior and Prisoner of Azkaban's film adaptation."

  "summary": "Hermione first met Harry Potter and Ron Weasley aboard the Hogwarts Express, who found her unfriendly and somewhat of an \"insufferable know-it-all\",  an impression reinforced by her constant correct answers and eagerness to please the professors. However, she stepped in to take the blame from the boys after they had saved her from a troll on Hallowe'en in 1991, surprising them in a grateful way, which led to them quickly becoming friends. In her second year, Hermione had a key role in the discovery of the Chamber of Secrets, before falling victim to the basilisk unleashed upon Hogwarts following the opening of the Chamber. The next year, Hermione was granted permission to use a Time-Turner from the Ministry of Magic to facilitate her volition to study far more subjects than were possible without time travel, though she and Harry later used it to rescue Sirius Black from the Dementor's Kiss and Buckbeak the hippogriff from execution. During her fourth year, Hermione became an advocate for the better treatment of house-elves, forming the association S.P.E.W., and helped in Harry's preparation for the Triwizard Tournament. In her fifth year, Hermione was the driving force behind the creation of Dumbledore's Army and fought alongside fellow D.A. In her sixth year, Hermione continued her role as Prefect and fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower."

The entrance to the Gryffindor common room was concealed under the portrait of the Fat Lady, on the lavish Gryffindor Landing.

The common room was a circular room where Gryffindor students could relax after a long day of studying. The common room was decorated in several shades of red, which was associated with the house. The common room was comfortable, but not more comfortable than the Hufflepuff basement.

Penny, however, enlisted Jacob's sibling help to expose Merula's fraudulency and reclaim the ownership of her Wit-Sharpening Potion, which ultimately resulted in the successful revelation of Merula's transgression and Penny being duly awarded her special recognition. During the 1988\u20131989 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Severus Snape taught his fifth year Potions students how to concoct this particular brew, in preparation for their Ordinary Wizarding Levels that year. During the 1994\u20131995 school year, Severus Snape taught his fourth year Potions students to make this potion shortly after the second task of the Triwizard Tournament in 1995. Snape found the trio reading the magazine, and, much to their humiliation, read it aloud to the entire class (the article falsely accused Hermione of toying with the hearts of both Viktor Krum and Harry). Snape split the group up, telling them to concentrate on their potions, but Harry found it difficult to do so, as Snape continued to goad him privately."

When Hagrid, a half-giant, rode it, the motorbike was large enough to fit him and could still carry an ordinary-sized person in its sidecar. Very likely he started to be interested in motorcycles during his teenage years, as his bedroom at Grimmauld Place was decorated with many pictures of motorcycles, supposedly kept on the wall by a Permanent Sticking Charm. As he got the flying motorbike in 1977, he probably got it after his escape from home and enchanted it soon afterwards. In 1977, both Sirius Black and his best friend James Potter used the motorbike while being chased by Muggle policemen for unknown reasons, likely speeding. Their chase came to a close when they were cornered in an alleyway by the two policemen, but Black and Potter escaped by flying over their heads and away on the motorcycle, to the great confusion of their pursuers. Sirius Black used the motorbike to fly from Peter Pettigrew's refuge to the Potters' house at Godric's Hollow on October 31st, 1981, just to find the house destroyed and both his best friend and the latter's wife dead. At first, Hagrid found this to be very odd, as Sirius \"loved that motorbike\", and before Sirius was shown to be innocent he suspected that it had something to do with his alleged betrayal of the Potters."

According to legend - as noted in The Tales of Beedle the Bard - they were created by Death himself as a reward to the Peverell brothers for having evaded him. The legend went that in the 13th century, the Peverell brothers managed to trick Death himself by using magic to conjure a bridge to cross a dangerous river. This was true in the case of Antioch Peverell, who was the original owner of the Elder Wand, and Cadmus Peverell, who was the original owner of the Resurrection Stone. However, while his brothers asked for something which gave them power, Ignotus Peverell asked for the Invisibility cloak so he could hide from Death. Out of this sprung a legend which said that whoever united the Hallows by possessing all three at the same time would become the Master of Death."

As the family grew over the birth of their children, the couple started building upward with add-on bits of architectural salvage they picked up wherever they could find. By the 1990s, the house was several stories high, with four or five chimneys on the roof, with all the appearance of being held up by magical means. The Weasleys had presumably been in residence at the Burrow for a long time, since at least 1970. The Burrow had been the home to the nine Weasleys, although their numbers had thinned over the years as the children grew up and moved out. Despite being poor, none of the Weasleys seemed ashamed of their home, and it had a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere. It was a welcoming place, and friends of the family were regular visitors."

He was eventually captured by Snatchers, but escaped Malfoy Manor along with several other prisoners and soon returned to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to participate in the Battle of Hogwarts. Dean is the son of a wizard father and a Muggle mother, though he believed he was Muggle-born when he went to Hogwarts.

During the 1984\u20131985 school year, Jacob's sibling and Merula Snyde were caught duelling over Merula's bullying of Ben Copper. In response, Albus Dumbledore formed the Hogwarts Duelling Club, under the supervision of Professor Flitwick and Jacob's sibling's Head of House, to allow students to practise in a safe and supervised manner. During the 1990\u20131991 school year at Hogwarts, Professor Cuthbert Binns had his seventh-year History of Magic research famous and historical duels for his class, with students having to research the subject in the Hogwarts Library and then produce a written essay in class. During the 1992\u20131993 school year, Albus Dumbledore allowed then Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor, Gilderoy Lockhart, to start a Duelling Club at Hogwarts, perhaps in part because he saw dark times coming in the wizarding world and therefore the need for training students in the art of battle. Professor Lockhart taught the formalities of duelling: bowing, holding the wand in a certain way, and flourishing the wand in the attack."

This allowed Remus Lupin (and James Potter, Peter Pettigrew, and Sirius Black) to pass between the two locations unnoticed (as Animagi or Werewolf). One year Sirius thought it would be funny to lure his arch-nemesis Severus Snape to the Shack where Lupin was due for his monthly transformation, in order to eliminate Snape from spying on them. James saved Severus in time, but not before Snape witnessed what Lupin was, though he was forbidden from telling anyone else.

The cup was said to possess many magical powers, though the exact nature of those powers is not known. Hufflepuff was brilliant with food-related charms and with house-elves, so the cup may have been the very first dining utensil at Hogwarts to assist in the magical transportation of food from the House-Elf Kitchens. The cup was passed down through the Hufflepuff family, and through the centuries made its way to Hepzibah Smith, a descendant who kept the cup as a priceless heirloom. In 1946, Smith showed the cup to Tom Marvolo Riddle, who was at that time employed at Borgin and Burkes. Along with the cup, Smith possessed Salazar Slytherin's locket."

In September 1927, Nagini and Credence decided to escape from the Circus Arcanus and discover his real identity. Amid her performance and transformation into a snake, Credence released firedrakes, so she attacked Skender to run away with Obscurial. Unbeknownst to Credence and Nagini, they were followed by one of Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes, Gunnar Grimmson."

During the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Gibbon set the Dark Mark above the Astronomy Tower. He was accidentally killed by fellow Death Eater Thorfinn Rowle, when he was hit by a stray Killing Curse. On 30 June 1997, Gibbon fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, along with fellow Death Eaters Alecto and Amycus Carrow, Corban Yaxley, Thorfinn Rowle, Draco Malfoy, Severus Snape, and Fenrir Greyback. Gibbon was the Death Eater who set the Dark Mark above the Astronomy Tower. It is supposed that he did not like the idea of staying at the tower and waiting for Albus Dumbledore alone, so he ran downstairs. He died shortly afterwards, when a stray Killing Curse cast by Thorfinn Rowle that missed Remus Lupin struck Gibbon instead. Almost nothing is known about Gibbon's exact personality, except the fact that he feared Albus Dumbledore and that he did not want to stay at the Astronomy Tower and wait for him alone."

If transformation is done improperly, the Transfigured object can become half-Transfigured or permanently stuck in one state (whether fully or partially Transfigured); for example, Viktor Krum half-Transfigured himself once into a shark in the Second Task of The Triwizard Tournament in 1994 (although he was not stuck in that form, so it may have been intentional)."

He was the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts, though he later became the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor during the 1991\u20131992 school year. Before teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts, Quirrell went out in search of Voldemort, believing he could achieve recognition for finding him and could learn things that would ensure that no one laughed at him again. However, Voldemort, after finding out that he taught at Hogwarts, took over his body, though Quirrell put up some feeble resistance. Quirinus Quirrell was born presumably before 26 September, 1967, somewhere in the British Isles, to a magical and a Muggle parent. Quirinus attended Hogwarts, where he was Sorted into Ravenclaw House. As a boy, Quirinus was gifted but also delicate, teased for his timidity and nerves during his school life. Feeling inadequate and wishing to prove himself, he developed an (initially theoretical) interest in the Dark Arts. The feelings of insignificance and worthlessness that this bullying fostered embittered the boy, forging a latent desire to make the world sit up and notice him. Minerva McGonagall was a professor during his time and was very kind and helpful to the young Quirrell, encouraging him to value knowledge."

The Runespoor was a three-headed snake native to Africa, with each head possessing its own evaluative function and venomous fangs, which were known to be long-lived, and their eggs were used in potion-making. The Horned Serpent was a giant water-dwelling snake, that many species were found worldwide. They had horns on their heads, in particular the North American variety, with jewels that granted the powers of invisibility and flight, and shavings of their horns could be used as wand cores. They were intelligent creatures with fierce eyes, who emitted a low musical note whenever they sensed danger. The Horned Serpent was the House mascot and symbol of the House of the same name at Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, as one of its founders, Isolt Sayre, had a close relationship with a Horned Serpent whilst exploring the United States of America. The Sea Serpent was an aquatic creature found in several seas worldwide, including the Atlantic, Pacific and the Mediterranean. It reached over a hundred feet long with a horse-like head and serpentine body; it was seen as a fearsome creature by many, although they did not harm humans, apart from the flesh-eating Selma.

  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Devil%27s_Snare",
  "summary": "Devil's Snare was a magical plant with the ability to constrict or strangle anything in its surrounding environment or something that happened to touch it. Devil's Snare did not seem to be common, but certain Herbologists had access to it. This plant used its creepers and tendrils to ensnare anyone who touched it, binding their arms and legs and eventually choking them. The harder a person struggled against Devil's Snare, the faster and more tightly it bound them. If the victim was able to maintain their presence of mind and relaxed, the Snare would relax its grip on them. Struggling or resistance to Devil's Snare would cause the plant to exert a greater force of constriction. Devil's Snare preferred a dark, damp environment. It would stop its movement in the environment in front of bright light and would recoil away from the heat of fire, so a well-placed fire or light based spell such as the Bluebell Flames, Fire-Making Spell, Wand-Lighting Charm or Lumos Solem Spell would effectively drive it away from its victims. In 1984, Merula Snyde was shown a Devil's Snare in a storehouse by fourth year Slytherin students shortly after her arrival. Later in the year, she tricked Jacob's sibling into entering the storeroom under the belief they were getting picked slugs for Professor Severus Snape in order to recover lost house points."

When cast successfully, the curse placed the victim completely under the caster's control, though a person with exceptional strength of will could resist it. The fact that the curse could be defended against, made it unique amongst the Unforgivable Curses. The Imperius Curse was deemed by the Ministry to be dark magic, and, along with the Cruciatus and Killing curses, were declared \"unforgivable\" in 1717. The use of any of these three curses on a fellow human being would result in a life sentence in Azkaban, unless there was sufficient evidence that the caster did so under the influence of another's Imperius Curse; this was known to be a loophole that many Dark Wizards and Witches abused and lied about while they were facing trial, awaiting their sentence to prison time, particularly after the First Wizarding War. Many Secret Keepers in the past have been subjected to the Imperius and Cruciatus Curses in an attempt to learn the secrets they keep, but to no avail as the Keeper must reveal it willingly. During the First Wizarding War, when Bartemius Crouch Senior was in charge of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, he fought violence with violence, and legalised the three Unforgivable Curses for Aurors against the Death Eaters in order to win the war. It was also at that time that many Death Eaters, such as Lucius Malfoy, Corban Yaxley, Walden Macnair,  Avery, Crabbe, Nott and Goyle claimed that they had served under Lord Voldemort only because of the Imperius Curse."

By November, despite efforts to keep the fact a secret, many students knew that Harry would be Gryffindor's new Seeker; some people thought Harry would be a great player, whilst others expected him to fall off his broom. On Saturday 9 November, the morning of the match, Harry found himself unable to eat anything for breakfast due to his nerves, but was encouraged by numerous Gryffindors to do so. Right before the start of the match, Captain Wood gave an intence speech to his teammates, one that Fred and George Weasley knew by heart, having been on the team last year. To begin, Madam Hooch informed all players that she wanted a nice, fair game, particularly speaking to Slytherin Quidditch Captain Marcus Flint.

At some point after he finished his magical education, Theseus would join the British Ministry of Magic, and complete a stringent series of character and aptitude tests to become a fully-fledged applicant for individuals wishing to work at the Auror Office in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, which he would eventually do after he successfully satisfied the requirements necessary to join their ranks by passing their notoriously demanding training programme. As such, when the Muggle world entered a period marked by a massive, military conflict that became known as the First World War, he would go on to be counted among the \"thousands\" who defied the then Minister for Magic Archer Evermonde's emergency legislation that forbade the British wizarding community to get involved in the hostilities. While not decisive, Theseus' participation in the wizarding effort of the war was nevertheless a distinguished one; earning him widespread recognition as a very powerful and commanding British Auror, as well as a war hero for his life-saving actions. A considerably hard-working and conscientious man, Theseus would continue to work for the Ministry following his return to Britain and rose to become a very high-ranking and well-respected Auror indeed, to the point where, when a Dark Wizard by the name of Gellert Grindelwald became active in the wizarding world and whose charismatic idealism had begun to muster support for the cause of bringing about the annulment of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy and subsequently earned him the discontent of both Theseus's own superiors as well as the International Confederation of Wizards, Theseus was assigned by the Ministry to leave for Europe to help track him down. At the time, he had no knowledge of his brother's whereabouts, whose work for the Dragon Research and Restraint Bureau involved extensive, research-related travelling, Theseus excitedly wrote him an owl and told him of his mission; wishing him well \"wherever \" on \"whatever beastly quests  undertaking!\". As the revolutionary endeavours of Grindelwald grew ever fiercer and the number of individuals who joined his cause began to increase steadily, with both Grindelwald and his supporters having began launching several devastating attacks across Europe, aimed at exposing wizardkind, and provoke war with the Muggle world, any help Theseus could have provided in opposing him were most likely halted by people in authority such as Minister Hector Fawley, who did not take the threat Grindelwald and his legion of fanatics seriously, seen as he was still working nationally by the mid-1920s."

Despite their fungi-like appearance, Horklumps were animals. Their preferred prey was the earthworm, which they hunted using the thin, muscular tentacles that they spread underground (similar to how fungi spread mycelia). Horklumps had no discernible use to wizards and witches, according to the famous magizoologist Newt Scamander, and were given the classification \"XX\" (\"harmless / may be domesticated\") by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. It was rumoured that Honoria, the aunt of Albus Dumbledore, called off her engagement to a wizard because she was shocked to catch him in the act of fondling some Horklumps (although she insisted it was because he was cold-hearted). In his book Marauding with Monsters, Gilderoy Lockhart wrote of how he once supposedly visited some fans in rural Essex, and helped clear a path through their Horklump-infested yard. Afterward, the fans allegedly offered him some of their homemade Celery and Beetroot Wine in gratitude, which he graciously declined. However, like most of Lockhart's accounts, this story might have been greatly exaggerated or completely fabricated. Lockhart recommended the following method for removing a Horklump in his book Marauding with Monsters: hitting it with a Knockback Jinx, taking a firm hold of it, and then twisting and yanking it out of the ground."

  "summary": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a British-American fantasy film based on the sixth novel by J. K. Rowling, released on 15 July, 2009. David Yates returned to direct the sequel to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, as did David Heyman and David Barron to produce, and Steve Kloves, though he did not write the fifth film, returned to write. Reprising their roles from earlier films are Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Helena Bonham Carter, Robbie Coltrane, Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Timothy Spall, David Thewlis, Julie Walters, Bonnie Wright, David Bradley, Warwick Davis, Tom Felton, Gemma Jones, Natalia Tena and Mark Williams, while Jim Broadbent and Helen McCrory make their debut for the series. Unlike the previous film, the sixth film was released in regular theatres on 15 July and IMAX 3-D on 29 July because of the IMAX release of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The film was chosen to be screened at the Royal Film Performance on 17 November, 2008, but due to the date of release being pushed back, it was not shown. On 7 July, 2009, at the world premiere of Half-Blood Prince in London, the cast and crew all wore white ribbons in memory and tribute of 18-year-old British actor and co-star Robert Knox. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defences and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information."

  "summary": "The village had both a Muggle and a magical community, the latter quietly established after the passing of the Statute of Secrecy in the 17th century. Four wizarding families were known to live around Ottery St Catchpole: the Weasleys, the Fawcetts, the Diggorys, and the Lovegoods. The Burrow was the home of the Weasley family, located in the south of the village and hidden behind hills and trees. A small cottage surrounded by a cluster of low hills was located a few hours' walking distance from the Weasley home, described as having a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill. It seemed to be deserted by the time Harry, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger walked past it, suggesting that the residents either had gone into hiding or went missing as a result to the war. There was a paper shop in the Muggle part of the village where a very pretty girl worked as a shopgirl, whom Fred and George Weasley had a liking for. On 1 September 1994, Molly Weasley went to the post office to use the phone, despite her unfamiliarity with using one, and ordered three ordinary Muggle taxis to drive Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and the Weasley family to King's Cross Station in London. Stoatshead Hill was a steep hill located outside the village of this town, and was one of two hundred sites throughout Britain selected to house Portkeys to the 1994 Quidditch World Cup."

  "summary": "Beauxbatons Academy of Magic (French: Acad\u00e9mie de Magie Beauxb\u00e2tons) was the French wizarding school, located in the Pyrenees mountains of southern France. The school took many of its wizarding students from France, as well as large numbers from Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium. The school's coat of arms consisted of two golden wands crossed over one another, each shooting three stars. Apart from the Flamels, famous ex-students of Beauxbatons included Vincent Duc de Trefle-Picques, who escaped the Terror by casting a Concealment Charm on his own neck and pretending that his head had already been cut off; Luc Millefeuille, the infamous pastry-maker and Muggle-poisoner; and Fleur Delacour, who fought in the world-famous Battle of Hogwarts, married Bill Weasley, and was awarded medals of bravery from both the French and British Ministries of Magic. Olympe Maxime, Headmistress in the mid 1990s, was (in spite of her protestations to the contrary) a half-giantess; clever, elegant, and undeniably awe-inspiring. However, the beast went on a rampage and injured three of the judges; one of the injured was at the time the head of Beauxbatons. In the 1994 tournament, Fleur was selected school champion and finished in fourth place behind the other three contestants. In 1927, French wizarding newspaper Le Cri de la Gargouille reported a potion scandal involving Beauxbatons students. The Palace of Beauxbatons was a beautiful chateau surrounded by majestic gardens and fountains magically created out of the surrounding mountains, and stood for over seven hundred years."

Following Harry Potter's survival of his duel with the Dark Lord after the latter returned to power and prior to his arrest after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Lucius would hold meetings with his fellow Death Eaters over the summer at his home to discuss the Rebirth of Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter's survival of the duel with the Dark Lord and the likely explanations for the odd reactions of their wands, during which his son Draco would grow increasingly (and secretly) envious of his school rival for being discussed seriously as an adversary, whereas he himself was still seen as a mere schoolboy by Death Eaters who met at his parents\u2019 house. By the summer of 1997, Lucius Malfoy and many other Death Eaters had escaped Azkaban prison, and the Dark Lord had made the Malfoys' home his headquarters, replacing the Riddle House in Little Hangleton. While the Malfoys were very uncomfortable with this, Bellatrix Lestrange, Lucius's sister-in-law, who also resided there, claimed there could be \"no higher pleasure\" than having Lord Voldemort stay with them. Shortly before Harry Potter's seventeenth birthday, Death Eaters Yaxley and Severus Snape entered the Manor to bring news of how the Ministry of Magic was being infiltrated and of the activities of the Order of the Phoenix, respectively. When Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger were caught by a group of Snatchers led by Fenrir Greyback around Easter of that year, they were brought to Malfoy Manor so that one of the Death Eaters residing there could signal Voldemort with the Dark Mark."

In addition to storing money and valuables for wizards and witches, one could go there to exchange Muggle money for wizarding money, which appeared to not be very difficult, as shown when Hermione Granger's parents did so while paying for her school supplies. According to Rubeus Hagrid, other than Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Gringotts was the safest place in the wizarding world. The motto of Gringotts Wizarding Bank was Fortius Quo Fidelius, a Latin phrase that meant \"Strength through loyalty\". The creation of Gringotts is considered to be linked to the 14th Century Wizarding Economic Bubble, which happened the century before. The bank was put in the hands of the Ministry of Magic shortly thereafter, being under some degree of wizarding management already by the 1500s' when Tertius applied for the job of Curse-Breaker to two wizards who were discussing job vacancies at the door to Gringotts. In 1865, the Ministry decided to put full control of Gringotts back in goblin hands. During Voldemort's control of the Ministry (1997 to 1998), the bank was put yet again under the Ministry, which placed their own people in charge of the security at the institution. So far, there had only been two known break-ins and theft (or attempted theft) of Gringotts Wizarding Bank, with one taking placing in 1991 and another in 1998."

Hippogriffs had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, but the front legs, wings, and heads of giant eagles, with cruel, steel-coloured beaks and large, brilliantly orange eyes. It was stated that, once you get over the initial shock of seeing something that's half horse, half bird, you start to appreciate the hippogriffs' gleaming coats, which changed smoothly from feathers to hair. Hippogriffs came in several different colours, including: stormy grey, bronze, pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black. Hippogriffs were carnivorous and were extremely dangerous until tamed, which should only be attempted by a trained witch or wizard. The diet of the Hippogriff consisted mainly of insects, birds, and small mammals such as ferrets. When breeding, Hippogriffs built nests on the ground, and laid only a single, fragile egg. Infant Hippogriffs were capable of Flight within a week, but it took many months before they were strong enough to accompany their parents on long journeys."

 "magic": {
  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Magic",
  "summary": "The ability for humans to use magic was a hereditary trait passed down from a person's ancestors, which allowed witches and wizards to practise it. Rather than being a mystical or unnatural pursuit that defied the laws of nature, however, magic simply allowed those who could wield it to exploit them in very specific and creative ways that Muggle science were unable to replicate. Magic also followed its own set of rules with respect to what it could do, such as how Conjured objects could only exist for a temporary period of time, and objects couldn't be enlarged beyond a certain point without becoming unstable and/or exploding. It was for this reason that promising young witches and wizards were sent to schools of magic, such as Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to refine their craft and learn the art and responsibility of their power. Magic was unable to be performed by non-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles), which was what separated the Muggle world from the wizarding world. As a substitute for magic, Muggles used technology, but in the same sense, many wizards were ignorant of the workings of most Muggle devices, including electricity. Squibs were also unable to perform magic, but they were in a unique position, as they were born into wizarding families, which gave them the option to choose between living in the wizarding world like a second-class citizen, or living in the Muggle world while concealing everything they knew about magic. As per the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, wizards and witches must constantly hide their magic abilities from the Muggle world, and thus most Muggles were unaware that magic existed."

  "summary": "The Forbidden Forest, also known as the Dark Forest, bordered the edges of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry grounds. The forest was a very old place that held many secrets and housed many creatures, some dark and dangerous, others friendly. As the forest's name suggests, it was strictly off limits to students \u2014 except in the case of detention, or Care of Magical Creatures lessons that occasionally took place there. Of course, with the various dangerous creatures living in the Forest, few students would even want to venture into it. Described by Professor Silvanus Kettleburn as \"massive\", the forest was thick with trees, such as beech, oak, pine, sycamore, and yew, as well as undergrowth such as knotgrass and thorns, but there were paths, brooks, and some clearings. Off the path, the way was almost impassable, although people had moved through it and creatures as large as Acromantulas and a Ford Anglia had managed to get around. There were areas around the edges of the forest that were part of the Hogwarts grounds, but which were out of sight of the castle. It was not entirely contained within the boundaries of the school itself, however, as Bartemius Crouch Senior was able to enter the grounds by foot by way of the Forbidden Forest from somewhere outside of it. Patricia Rakepick, who had lured one of the students at the school and attacked them and their friends, was also able to flee the scene of the crime by Disapparating following the murder of Rowan Khanna, showing that if one went deep enough into the forest, one would eventually end up outside the school grounds and the boundaries of the spells protecting it. It was hard to navigate the Forest at night, as there were tree roots and stumps that were barely visible in near blackness."

The Latin word sanguini is the dative singular of the noun sanguis, \"blood\", and means literally \"to blood\" or \"for blood.\" Other possible influences derived from this Latin root include French sang and Italian sangue, both meaning \"blood\", and the English words exsanguination, \"to bleed out\", and sanguine, describing a blood colour or having an active, warm and lively circulation or temper.

Harry Potter, Slughorn's most welcomed guest, overheard a strange conversation between Professor\u00a0Severus Snape and student Draco Malfoy during the party that made him suspect that they were conspiring on behalf of Lord Voldemort. Horace Slughorn returned to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from retirement for the 1996\u20131997 school year, and resumed his former position as Potions Master. Slughorn liked to hold dinners with these students and cultivate their talents, in the hopes that someday they would fulfil the potential he saw in them and be valuable connections. As the famous \u201cBoy Who Lived\u201d, Harry Potter immediately attracted Slughorn\u2019s attention. When planning his party for Christmas, Slughorn wanted to make sure that Harry would attend, and thus asked Hermione Granger, a member of the Slug Club and Harry\u2019s friend, when he would be available. When Hermione related this news to Harry and Ron Weasley, the former groaned in frustration, but Ron was irritated, as Professor Slughorn had ignored him entirely. Hermione interrupted his envious criticisms by asking if he would like to go with her, and Ron accepted, looking \u201csheepish but also rather pleased with himself\u201d. Harry wondered to himself how this development would affect the trio\u2019s dynamics, but the only difference was that Hermione and Ron were a little politer to each other than usual. In the meantime, Ron began treating Hermione coldly after his sister revealed that she had once kissed Viktor Krum, and even more so after Harry pretended to slip him Felix Felicis to help his Quidditch nerves; once Harry revealed the truth, Ron accused Hermione of having no faith in him, despite having believed it himself."

Greyback fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, where he at one point attacked  Lavender Brown, but was incapacitated by Hermione Granger and then a crystal ball to the head by Professor Trelawney.

 "spell": {
  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Spell",
  "summary": "Generally cast by a witch or a wizard, spells were often produced with an incantation, and could appear as jets of light. Because of this, spells could often miss, be dodged, or blocked, either with an object or another spell. Normally, spells required four main factors to be properly accounted for in order to succeed: wand movement, incantation, concentration and intention. If one did not move their wand in the correct way, did not speak the incantation properly and/or could not retain their concentration and/or desired outcome in their imagination during casting, then the spell would fail or backfire. It should be noted that spells could be performed with or without speech and wands, though non-verbal and wandless spells were much more difficult and hence were usually not taught to practitioners until they reached a more advanced level, such as the sixth year of study at Hogwarts. Notable practitioners of non-verbal spells included Albus Dumbledore, Tom Riddle, and Severus Snape, who were also known to perform wandless spells. It could be that, in other countries and wizarding territories, spells with an English incantation or another incantation other than Latin-based, could be used in other languages, as long as wizards used the same wand movement, concentration and intention. When performed, spells usually manifested as light, sparks, lightning, or fiery energy of various colours from the wand they were cast with, such as the tell-tale red of Stupefy or green of Avada Kedavra. Some spells also made loud noises when cast, although Harry Potter noted that \"bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than experience.\""

John was born somewhere in the British Isles, into the wizarding Dawlish family at some point between a hundred year period of 1875 and 1975. Sometime after his seventeenth birthday, Dawlish joined the Ministry of Magic, and completed a stringent series of character and aptitude tests to be accepted into the comprehensive, three year long programme subscribed to potential applicants for the Auror Office. On 20 April, 1996, after Marietta Edgecombe denounced the illegal Dumbledore's Army to Dolores Umbridge, Minister Cornelius Fudge travelled to Hogwarts Castle in an attempt to expel Harry Potter, who was leading the outlawed student group. Kingsley Shacklebolt and John Dawlish escorted the Minister there, and were positioned on either side of the door to the Headmaster's office. After Fudge accused him of treason and sedition against himself and the Ministry of Magic, Fudge made a small choking noise, and then looked round at Kingsley and Dawlish. Dumbledore warned him not to be foolish, saying that he would have to hurt Dawlish if he attacked him, and the Auror blinked rather foolishly, without a clue as to what to do next. Fudge ordered the Aurors to seize Dumbledore, but the Headmaster easily defeated the Ministry officials, leaving Fudge, Umbridge, Kingsley and Dawlish unconscious on the floor as he escaped."

 "wand core": {
  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wand_core",
  "summary": "Although wand cores varied widely, certain wandmakers preferred to use certain materials; for example, Garrick Ollivander discovered and pioneered the use of phoenix feathers, dragon heartstrings, and unicorn tail hairs, whereas his father used lesser substances such as Kelpie hair and Kneazle whiskers. For example, the wand-maker Garrick Ollivander would not use Veela hair for cores because he believed they made for \"temperamental\" wands. When Chadwick and Webster Boot used them as a team, their wands with cores from the same Horned Serpent increased in power tenfold. However, when they were used in conflict with another, the connecting spells created Priori Incantatem, as seen when the wands of Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort, which both had cores comprised of a feather from Fawkes, Albus Dumbledore's phoenix, connected. Before Garrick Ollivander's practice of using only the three \"Supreme Cores\", it was common for witches and wizards to present a wandmaker with a magical substance to which they had a particular attachment for use as a wand core. However, when Garrick watched his father, Gervaise Ollivander, struggle with substandard wand cores such as Kneazle whiskers, Dittany stalks, or Kelpie manes, he decided to devote his time to studying the finest wand cores. All wands sold by Garrick Ollivander cost seven galleons, regardless of core or wood."

  "summary": "She knows her characters and her universe inside out, she\u2019s one of the most dynamic thinkers I\u2019ve ever met, and for someone who has enjoyed so much success she is incredibly grounded. Her storytelling is singular, yet she approaches the filmmaking process as producer and screenwriter with a genuinely collaborative spirit. I first read Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald in the spring of 2016, a full year and two months before we began shooting the film. The script felt layered, emotional, and that most precious of things: itself. Whether the thrill of recreating Paris in the late 1920s, wrangling a new collection of wonderful beasts, or exploring an emotional, multi-stranded story with compelling characters and themes, each day of prep and production was always exciting as well as fun. Above all, however, it was the characters that captured and beguiled me on that first read; they are timeless, enchanting, intriguing. All of them are being tested to their core, navigating a world that is becoming ever more complex and dangerous\u2014a world that, however heightened and magical, in some ways echoes our own across time.\" - David Yates September 9, 2018\nThe cover was designed in the theme of the second film, with the Eiffel Tower representing the main setting of the film - Paris.

  "summary": "The game was released on 30 June, 2009, on the Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Wii, and Xbox 360 platforms. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore prepares Harry for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching as Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defences and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information about Voldemort's power. The steps include picking up vials of liquid, shaking them (by shaking the Wii Remote) until they froth, and tipping the Wii Remote to pour it into the mixture, being very careful not to pour in too much. Harry Potter can duel against Draco Malfoy in a Duelling Room with a long platform, similar to the one seen in the second film, but wider to allow dodging of spells. Moving in order to dodge is done with the Nunchuk Control Stick, while casting spells is done with Wii Remote and Nunchuk gestures. Combat spells currently implemented include a shield spell (\"Protego\") cast by crossing the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, a standard attack spell by striking downwards with the Wii Remote (\"Stupefy\"), a charged version by holding the Wii Remote up for longer first, and a more powerful attack spell by swinging the Wii Remote and Nunchuck to the left."

Each country had a form of wizarding government to oversee magical affairs in their territory, such as a Ministry of Magic or a Council of Magic. Magic was honed through study, training and formal schooling, but couldn't be simply learnt by Muggles. Non-magic skills, such as picking a lock with a hairpin rather than an Unlocking Charm, were uncommon to the point of novel rarity. Magic was used for mostly everything, including cooking, cleaning, travelling, communicating, child rearing and medical treatment. Although on the surface, magic appeared morally neutral, the benevolence or malevolence of a spell's nature was tied to the intention behind it. The technology of the wizarding world appeared medieval in character (such as Hogwarts not having any lifts, but instead having only stairs), as the use of magic precluded the need for advanced technology (as well as the fact that magic interfered with electrical equipment). The Minister was elected, but it was unknown who has the power to elect him, although there does seem to be some degree of input from the general wizarding population."

 "muggle duelling": {
  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Muggle_duelling",
  "summary": "Muggle duelling was a wizarding term used to refer to non-magical combat \u2014 that is, fighting without the use of wands or spells. It was thus in direct contrast with a formal wizard's duel, in which combatants might only use magic against their opponent and Muggle duelling was an illegal tactic. In most cases, Muggle duelling involved the use of one's own body for attacking, such as punching, kicking, or tackling. Though usually undertaken by Muggles, who obviously couldn't perform magic, wizards had been known to engage in Muggle duelling on occasion. In the wizarding world, Muggle duelling was seen as particularly dishonourable and unscrupulous, and as such, it was typically only done by inexperienced or impulsive wizards, or those who were in especially messy confrontations. In extreme cases, Muggle duelling could also involve weaponry, such as knives, swords, or even firearms. Prior to the establishment of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, wizards intermingled freely with Muggles, and many wizards were accustomed with formal Muggle duelling as well as wizard duelling, as it was considered unsporting to use magic in a duel against a Muggle. Godric Gryffindor was a noted practitioner of both varieties of duels, and carried the Sword of Gryffindor for the purpose of duelling Muggles on equal ground. At Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Muggle duelling is against the rules along with Wizard duelling and is furthermore considered a childish activity to be caught doing."

The ICWQC was created following the implementation of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy in 1692, which made the Quidditch World Cup a security risk, as the mass congregation of so many wizards entailed exposure to Muggles. Following mass protests and threats to the International Confederation of Wizards, this committee was set up to deal with the most problematic logistical issues. In 1995, a motion to restrict mascots to \"herbivores, creatures smaller than a cow and nothing that breathes fire\" was defeated by an overwhelming majority, and Quidditch supporters have been resistant to any meddling as far as team mascots are concerned."

Upon returning to Harry Potter for the first time since 2007, Rowling commented: \"I always said that I would only revisit the wizarding world if I had an idea that I was really excited about and this is it.\" She stated that the idea of seeing Scamander \"realised by another author was difficult,\" hence her decision to be the film's screenwriter.

Hogsmeade was a picturesque little village of cottages and shops, with enchanted candles hanging in the trees during the holidays. According to tradition, Hogsmeade was founded in the 10th or 11th century, around the same time as Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, by medieval wizard Hengist of Woodcroft as he was fleeing persecution by Muggles. In November 1926, the Daily Prophet reported that Hogsmeade would play host to the first ever Magical Waterplants Festival. At some point in the village's history, it was acknowledged that some of its residents had a tendency to be particularly prone to accidents and injury, to the point where these unlucky locals were being consolationally awarded for their trouble. As of the 1987\u20131988 school year, one of its inhabitants, a former Care of Magical Creatures Professor at the nearby Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Silvanus Kettleburn, had received the Hogsmeade's Most Maimed Award ten years in a row.

Honeydukes also housed the entrance to a secret passageway from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry directly into the cellar of the sweet-shop; however, it was advisable only to use it to go from Hogwarts Castle to Honeydukes and not the other way around, due to the presence of a stone slide at the Hogwarts end. In the Gunhilda of Gorsemoor Corridor on the third floor of Hogwarts Castle, one could find a large stone statue of Gunhilda. By tapping the back of the statue with one's wand and incant \"Dissendium\", one would open up the secret passageway in the statue's hunched back, leading down a short, cool stone slide. They would land in a very low, very narrow earthy passageway that twisted like a rabbit's burrow, rising after an hour or so and reached a large, worn stone staircase after ten minutes of steep ascent. The cellar of the shop was full of wooden crates and boxes, with a very dusty floor and a large wooden staircase leading up to the main shop. In the cellar, one could hear the opening and shutting of the sweet-shop door, as well as the tinkling of the bell above it.

With the lawsuit of Warner Bros and J.K. Rowling versus RDR Books, which overlooks the possible publication of Vandar Ark's printed version of his online site HP Lexicon; J.K. Rowling took legal action to defend her fictional world and the possibility of herself creating her own version of an encyclopaedia or companion book to go along with the Harry Potter series. J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter books, asserts that this reference guide infringes both her copyright in the seven Potter novels and her right to publish, at some unidentified point in the future, a reference guide of her own.

Creating a Philosopher's Stone was one of the best known goals of Alchemy, and Alchemists have sought to produce the stone for centuries. Critics of the legend of the Deathly Hallows have suggested that Beedle the Bard (c. 15th century) was inspired to create the life-restoring Resurrection Stone from the life-extending Philosopher's Stone. Despite countless attempts over the ages, the only Stone known to exist was created by famed French alchemist, Nicolas Flamel, sometime in the 14th century or later. While living in Paris in 1927, Flamel kept the Philosopher's Stone in the back of a shelf next to his phoenix book in a glass dome where it could be seen when he met Jacob Kowalski. During Gilderoy Lockhart's student days at Hogwarts, he would rant to anyone who would bother to listen about planning to achieve many impressive feats, one of which is to create a Philosopher's Stone before graduation; of course, he never did so. In 1991, the Philosopher's Stone became the target of the Dark Wizard Lord Voldemort, who intended to use the Elixir of Life to create a new body for his mangled soul after being disembodied during his failed attack on Godric's Hollow in 1981."

Broomsticks appeared to have a bit of a personality of their own, as they were able to respond to the simplest of commands, such as \"Up!\". Since no spell was devised by wizards to enable them to fly (with the exception of Lord Voldemort in 1997, and Severus Snape a year later) they had to come up with another way to do so. Long before the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy came into force, wizards were savvy enough to realise that Muggle neighbours would seek to exploit their abilities. The broomstick was ideal \u2014 it was portable, cheap, and required no explanation. However, the first broomsticks were uncomfortable."

The book was published for the general public on 4 December 2008, with the proceeds going to the Children's High Level Group. Originally, The Tales of Beedle the Bard had only been produced in a limited number of seven handmade copies, all handwritten and illustrated by the author herself. The books were bound in brown morocco leather, and decorated with hand-chased silver ornaments and mounted semiprecious stones by silversmith and jeweller Hamilton & Inches of Edinburgh (they also worked with Rowling on a charm bracelet she auctioned)."

The third title in EA's action-adventure Harry Potter franchise, it has a unique feel and gameplay, with elements not present in any other game of the franchise, including a camera of a 3D environment that is not player-controlled and a system in which previous levels can be played again at will. Due to higher-quality graphics in comparison to previous Harry Potter video games, characters more closely resemble their movie counterparts. Instead, the player selects one among several nonconsecutive levels to play on a special menu that shows Dumbledore's pensieve. Just like the previous game, the three playable characters are Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley; namely the main characters in the movie. In this game, however, the player(s) can choose which one(s) to control at the beginning of each level (with a few exceptions, such as the Triwizard tasks, in which only Harry appears). Similarly to Prisoner of Azkaban, also, the three characters can cast collaborative spells that are more powerful or produce better results, which can happen either in solo or in multiplayer."

In 1981, shortly after Voldemort's first defeat, Crouch allegedly participated in the capture and torture of Frank and Alice Longbottom along with the Lestranges, using the Cruciatus Curse to drive the two Aurors to insanity. Crouch and his parents hatched a plot under which Crouch's mother would take his place in Azkaban, using the Polyjuice Potion to disguise herself. She died and was buried in Azkaban, with the result that the wizarding world believed that Crouch himself was dead. He eventually broke free with the help of Voldemort, who had learned that Crouch was still alive, making him enter the Dark Lord's service again. In this role, Crouch fixed the Triwizard Tournament so that Harry Potter was chosen as a champion, and turned the Triwizard Cup into a Portkey that transported Harry and Cedric Diggory to Voldemort. Shortly afterwards, his identity was exposed, and Crouch was given the Dementor's Kiss by a Dementor that Cornelius Fudge had brought along with him. Barty was born in around 1962 or 1963 into the influential pure-blood Crouch family, which had strong connections to the Ministry of Magic."

  "summary": "Official translations have been done in the following languages (languages are listed twice if more than one translation was prepared, once if the difference is merely a difference of country and distributor):\nSome sources refer to translations \"from Arabic to Zulu\", but the books have never officially been translated into Zulu. Some translations, such as those to the dead Latin and Ancient Greek, were done as academic exercises, to stimulate interest in the languages and to give students of those languages modern texts to read. Note that in some countries, such as Spain and India, the book has been translated into several local languages (see section on publishers); sometimes the book has been translated into two dialects of the same language in two countries (for example, Portuguese versions for Brazil and Portugal). As with many texts, the Harry Potter series presents some special challenges to translators:\nThe cultural environment of the book is decidedly English. The stories follow a familiar theme in English children's books, that of adventures at boarding school, and many of the cultural nuances will be unfamiliar to readers in translation. The language of the books, reflected, for example, in Hagrid's manner of speaking, reveals much about the various characters. Scholastic executives chose to issue the books with some adaptations to American English, a practice which is quite common with books that \"cross the pond\" in either direction, but which was met with a certain amount of reader outrage in the case of Harry Potter. A significant change was made to the American edition of the first book (which was also reflected in the title of the first movie when distributed in that country) in that Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was retitled Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (with applicable changes to the text). Although translated titles often result in wording changes, this is a rare care when a non-UK edition in a common language, English, was so retitled."

  "summary": "An individual male human with magical ability was known as a wizard (plural: wizards), and an individual female human with magical ability was known as a witch (plural: witches), though \"wizard\" was sometimes used as a gender-neutral singular noun like \"man\". There were three statues of wizardkind, Pure-blood, half-blood and Muggle-borns, and they were relative to Squibs and Muggles. It was said that most of the greatest wizards did not have an ounce of logic, suggesting their complete reliance of powerful magic led them to neglect other aspects of their mind. Whether, in ancient times, some humans randomly discovered they had magic, or there was some sort of ritual or potion or pact, their origins remain a mystery. However, if it was the first, then some Muggle-borns may not be the descendants of Squibs (as is most often theorised) but entirely new wizards, like the very first members of wizardkind. In childhood, wizards and witches may have exhibited random bursts of magic, called accidental magic, which were honed and controlled as they progress to maturity. To perform controlled magic, almost all wizards/witches needed to use a wand, although the advanced skill of wandless magic may have been mastered in later life. A few highly advanced wizards could do controlled magical feats without a wand, such as Albus Dumbledore, who demonstrated the ability at the close of Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Lord Voldemort, who once demonstrated this ability during the Battle of the Seven Potters in 1997. However, many believed a pure-blood family tree should have no Muggle ancestors despite the fact that every family tree had at least one Muggle ancestor by the 1990s."

He began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1971 and was sorted into Gryffindor House after the Sorting Hat pondered over which house he belonged in for over five minutes, a true Hatstall. During his years at Hogwarts, he became one of the Marauders; he was best friends with Sirius Black, James Potter, and Remus Lupin, and together they created the Marauder's Map. During the First Wizarding War, Peter was a member of the Order of the Phoenix, but became a spy when he was coerced into joining Lord Voldemort. He was made Secret-Keeper for the Potters when they went into hiding with the use of the Fidelius Charm, and betrayed James, his wife Lily, and their son Harry to Lord Voldemort. After Voldemort's fall, he faked his own death and framed Sirius for betraying James and Lily, as well as for his own murder and those of the twelve Muggles he killed during his escape. Peter spent twelve years living in his Animagus form as the Weasley family's pet rat, Scabbers. However, his identity was exposed by Sirius and Remus in 1994, and Pettigrew, with nowhere else to go, sought protection in returning to the service of Lord Voldemort, whom he found in the forests of Albania. The silver hand Lord Voldemort had given Pettigrew interpreted his hesitation as weakness and/or disloyalty, and strangled him to death, saving Harry and finally finding redemption for his treason, despite his reputation remained tarnished as many remained dubious of the evidence of his innate bravery."

Severus started at Hogwarts with Lily in 1971, where he was Sorted into Slytherin House. This put his friendship with Lily, a Muggle-born, under great strain until it was eventually broken in their fifth year. In an attempt to win back Lily's affections, Snape joined the Death Eaters along with a group of his fellow Slytherins. Severus was made a member of the Slug Club presumably because of his talent in Potion-making and Horace Slughorn kept a picture of him as a student, clutching his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. Despite this, Horace did not have many hopes for Severus's future, as his photograph was kept behind many others.

Dedalus was presumably one of the members of the Order of the Phoenix assigned to discreetly keep a close eye on Harry Potter seen as he once met The Boy Who Lived during his early childhood in a shop.

 "battle of the astronomy tower": {

  "summary": "Lord Voldemort secretly organised the attack by ordering sixteen-year-old Death Eater and Hogwarts student Draco Malfoy to assassinate Albus Dumbledore, the only wizard in the world who Voldemort feared. Although his previous attempts at assassination had failed, Draco managed to sneak a number of Death Eaters into Hogwarts via a pair of Vanishing Cabinets in the Room of Requirement, and they encountered a number of Hogwarts teachers, students, Dumbledore's Army members, and Order of the Phoenix members, who had been standing guard at the school at the request of both Dumbledore and Harry Potter. As the Order of the Phoenix and the Death Eaters battled, Severus Snape killed Dumbledore, an act that was later discovered to have been secretly planned between Dumbledore and Snape, as Dumbledore would soon afterwards still have died after putting on Marvolo Gaunt's cursed ring, which was a Horcrux, and was afflicted with a deadly curse that would have eventually killed him anyway. As a result of Lucius Malfoy's failure to obtain the prophecy during The Battle of The Ministry of Magic in June of 1996, Lord Voldemort, furious at Lucius's failure and the fact that some of his top Death Eaters had been re-entombed in Azkaban, decided that Lucius's son, Draco Malfoy, should become a Death Eater, and that he should carry out the mission of killing Dumbledore, rather than Voldemort himself; due to Dumbledore having easily rivalled and surpassed the Dark Lord in power during their duel at the Ministry Of Magic the year prior. Narcissa Malfoy, however, strongly suspected that Voldemort had given Draco this task as a form of secret revenge against Lucius, as The Dark Lord foolishly believed that Dumbledore would kill Draco if he discovered any assassination attempts on his life. Narcissa then assumed that Voldemort literally intended for Draco to die in the performance of his duties, either by Dumbledore's hands or by Voldemort's hands. Draco then spent most of his sixth year at Hogwarts repairing a Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement in order to secretly connect it with the one in Borgin and Burkes in Knockturn Alley, so that Death Eaters could secretly enter Hogwarts, despite the increased magical protection surrounding the school."

 "death": {

  "summary": "Death is the end of a living organism's life, technically defined in humans as the permanent termination of brain activity. Death, defined in magical terms, was the end of a body's life due to illness, or injury, and the departure of the soul that occupied it. The power of death and related concepts were deeply fundamental issues within magic, and some of the most important unchanneled magic that witches and wizards could perform relied on death as an organising principle. Death was as permanent and irreversible in the magical world as outside of it, though the wall separating death and life was in general much more porous due to the effects of magic: ghosts could be left by living things as a permanent imprint of themselves after death; portraits of dead witches and wizards maintained their personalities and some of their memories; powerful magic like that of Priori Incantatem, Horcruxes, and the Resurrection Stone could recall substantial memories of the dead temporarily into the midst of the living; there was an archway on a dais in the Department of Mysteries that formed a physical portal between life and death; and it was possible in the rarest of cases for wizards to visit the borderlands between death and life, in a state called Limbo, and return to the world of the living. The Grim, which took in the form of a large black dog, was believed to be an omen of death, and even a cause of death to others, as some people who spotted it died 24 hours later while others believed it would haunt them until they finally died. The Grim was the main omen and manifestation of death which had been prophecied for decades by Seers, and Seers who had the gift of sight but lacked the gift of interpretation, could misinterpret a wizard in an Animagus form similar to the Grim as the Grim itself, which was especially the case for Sybill Trelawney, who mistook Sirius Black's dog Animagus form as the Grim. This manifestation and embodiment of Death appeared treacherous and tricked the brothers into using the Deathly Hallows for their own personal gain in revenge for cheating him with their magical powers, knowing that the brothers would eventually be reclaimed by Death as his own."

 "animagus": {

  "summary": "It took skill, practice, and patience for wizards and witches to become Animagi. The process of becoming an Animagus was long and arduous, and had the potential to backfire and cause the transformation to go horribly wrong. Many witches and wizards simply felt that their time might better be employed in other ways, as the skill was of limited practical use unless one had a great need of disguise or concealment. Part of the process by which one became an Animagus was holding the leaf of a Mandrake in their mouth for an entire month, using the leaf for the creation of a potion, reciting an incantation (Amato Animo Animato Animagus) on a daily basis, and drinking the Animagus potion during a lightning storm. Once the initial training was over, an Animagus could then change at will, with or without the use of a wand. Animagi who took on the form of species capable of flight could enjoy the sensation without the need of broomsticks, flying carpets, or riding on flying animals. It was debated (but generally believed possible) for one's Animagus form to be a magical creature, and also debated (but generally believed impossible) for an Animagus to be a Dementor. The process was extremely difficult and could result in disaster (such as permanent half-human, half-animal mutations) if done incorrectly. A witch or wizard had to keep a single mandrake leaf in their mouth for an entire month (from full moon to full moon)."

It is implied that Crimp may have continued to use it, or cast a curse on Snickerton with similar effects, as all of his subsequent creations were found sliced up. The incantation is the Latin first person active indicative for \"to split, cleave or open\"."

  "summary": "Defence Against the Dark Arts (abbreviated as DADA) was a subject taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In this class, students studied and learnt how to defend themselves against all aspects of the Dark Arts, including dark creatures, curses, hexes and jinxes (dark charms), and duelling. The position of Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at the school was once rumoured to be jinxed, as no teacher could hold the post for more than a year without suffering an unpleasant fate. Defence Against the Dark Arts was a required subject from first year to fifth year. Tom Riddle twice applied for the Defence Against the Dark Arts position, the first time shortly after graduation from Hogwarts when he was turned down by Headmaster Armando Dippet, who claimed he was too young but invited him to re-apply a few years later. Many years later, after becoming steeped in the Dark Arts and starting to use the title \"Lord Voldemort\", he visited the school and applied again, this time to Dumbledore. According to Albus Dumbledore, after the second refusal, no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher held the post for more than one school year."

During their time at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, James Potter cast the counter-curse for the Full Body-Bind Curse that Sirius Black had cast on Severus Snape after being let down from the jinx Levicorpus James had cast on him. On 31 July 1991, during his first trip to Diagon Alley, Harry Potter was interested in buying Curses and Counter-Curses. In 1991, Professor Snape used a counter-curse to protect Harry Potter from a jinx put on his broom by Professor Quirrell, who was trying to knock him off. Also in 1991, Hermione Granger performed the counter-curse to the Leg-Locker Curse for Neville Longbottom after Draco Malfoy cast it on him. In the 1994\u20131995 school year, Bartemius Crouch Junior (in the guise of Alastor Moody) told his Fourth year Defence Against the Dark Arts students that according to the British Ministry of Magic, he was only supposed to teach them counter-curses and not show them illegal Dark curses. During Dumbledore's Army's meetings, Neville Longbottom worked relentlessly on learning every counter-curse that Harry taught them. In the 1995\u20131996 school year, Parvati Patil questioned Dolores Umbridge about needing to know how to perform counter-curses for the practical portion of their Ordinary Wizarding Level exams. In the 1996\u20131997 school year, the British Ministry for Magic helped protect Hogwarts with defensive spells and charms, including an array of counter-curses. Harry Potter used Liberacorpus, the counter-spell of Levicorpus (a spell he found in the Half-Blood Prince's book), on Ron Weasley, in the Gryffindor Boys' Dormitory."

In Hagrid's third year, he was framed by Tom Riddle for the crime of opening the Chamber of Secrets and using his pet Acromantula to attack several Muggle-born students and eventually killing one of them. Though Hagrid's wand was snapped and he was expelled, he was trained as gamekeeper of Hogwarts and allowed to live on the school grounds at the request of Albus Dumbledore. As a member of both the original and the re-instated Order of the Phoenix, Hagrid fought in several battles of the First and the Second Wizarding Wars, including the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998. By 2017, he was still living, and presumably still teaching and tending to his gamekeeping duties at Hogwarts, inviting Harry's son Albus Severus for tea when he joined the school as Harry informed him at the station, just as Hagrid had done for his father, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Hagrid was born on 6 December 1928 to Mr Hagrid, a wizard, and Fridwulfa, a giantess, and grew up in the West Country of England, near the Forest of Dean, where he acquired his distinctive accent. When Hagrid was about three, his mother returned to her Giant colony, leaving his father to raise him alone. Hagrid said he had very few memories of his mother from his childhood, but remembered his father fondly; as a half-giant, he overtook his father in size by the age of six, and amused the \"tiny\" wizard by picking him up and setting him on top of a dresser when Hagrid was annoyed with him. Hagrid's father was thrilled when his son was accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where Hagrid began his education in 1940 in which he was Sorted into Gryffindor House."

Mr Hagrid was at first unsure whether Rubeus could be a wizard, considering his giant blood, but he was delighted when Rubeus received his Hogwarts acceptance letter in 1940. By that point, Rubeus could carry his father on his shoulders, and Mr Hagrid was described as \"beaming\" in a photograph taken of them together.

  "summary": "The First Wizarding War was a major wizarding conflict, with foundations as early as the 1940s, but officially beginning in 1970 and ending in 1981. The Dark Lord's insurgency was supported by his Death Eaters, a covert and violent group of dark wizards and dark witches who served him and brought terror to both the Muggle and Wizarding Worlds. They were opposed in turn by the British Ministry of Magic and the Order of the Phoenix, an equally secretive organisation founded and led by Albus Dumbledore, which would play a crucial role in both of Voldemort's defeats. The First Wizarding War had its roots secretly planted when Tom Marvolo Riddle was born on 31 December, 1926, to Tom Riddle Senior, a wealthy Muggle aristocrat whose family was the locally unpopular gentry within the village of Little Hangleton, England, Great Britain, and Merope Gaunt, a pure-blood vagabond witch born into the antisocially dysfunctional and heavily inbred supremacist House of Gaunt, who lived in poverty across the valley from the village. Having eloped with Riddle Snr, while the latter was secretly influenced by a Love Potion, the couple caused a great scandal among the villagers over the common unpopularity (although for differing reasons) of the two families. But Merope grew tired of living such a lie when pregnant three months later, and thus lifted the bewitchment on her husband in hopes that he would either return her feelings or stay for their child's sake. Spending the rest of her life as a pauper on the streets of London, England, Merope sold a few stolen Gaunt heirlooms, and died in childbirth while sheltered in the Muggle-run Wool's Orphanage. As a result, the orphaned Riddle was left to spend the first eleven years of his life in said orphanage, where the coercive circumstances of his conception and extreme lack of parental love likely contributed to his many early warning signs of juvenile delinquency. During this time, the secret Wizarding World to which Riddle unknowingly belonged to developed new levels of anti-Muggle sentiment and economic growth."

Around 1931, the giantess Fridwulfa abandoned her human husband Mr Hagrid and their infant child Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant, who was smaller in stature than she wanted. The two gave birth to the giant Grawp who, despite being a full-blooded giant, was still particularly small, and due to this he, too, was abandoned. Rubeus Hagrid, along with his newly-found friend Olympe Maxime, paid a visit to a tribe of giants in June of 1995, on the orders of headmaster Albus Dumbledore of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in an attempt to bring the giants over as allies of the Order of the Phoenix in the war against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. After three days at the giant camp, Hagrid discovered his half-brother Grawp. He later dragged Grawp back to Hogwarts with him due to the bullying he knew Grawp had received, and presumably to protect Grawp from Voldemort's enslavement of the giants. Despite his previous abuse, Grawp continuously attempted to return to the camp, but Hagrid forced him through England against his will. During a Quidditch Match in 1996, in which Ron Weasley played as Keeper, Hagrid secretly revealed Grawp's presence to Harry Potter and Hermione Granger, asking them to look after Grawp in case he got sacked by Dolores Umbridge. After Hagrid was later temporarily sacked by Umbridge, Grawp became upset about his absence and after chasing the centaurs away from Harry and Hermione before they could attack them, demanded about Hagrid's presence from Hermione, who responded that she didn't know where he was."

All known half-giants had magical blood and were capable of producing magic, traits they received from their witch or wizard ancestors. From their giant family they usually retained a large height and build, they were usually considered extremely tall by human standards and short by giant standards. The large physical build of half-giants lends itself easily to great physical strength and stamina that could rival many, if not most magical creatures, with endurance dependent on how active an individual's lifestyle was. They were also gifted with human intelligence, enabling them to learn the use of magic at a wizarding school and the right to own a wand. Despite their immense stature, half-giants appeared otherwise indistinguishable from humans, as their proportions relative to their size were not said to be abnormal, meaning that they simply appeared as oversized humans. The very act of a Muggle even meeting a giant, let alone having offspring with one, would be a breach of Clause 73 of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy. Half-giants could not use any potion that was only designed for human physiology, such as Polyjuice Potion. Many half-giants have been discriminated against, as with werewolves, centaurs, and other half-humans."

As the guests fly out of one of the Observatory's arches, the ride smoothly switches to a wrap-around projection screen and they follow Harry Potter and Ron Weasley around Hogwarts' buildings and towers to their Quidditch match. As Harry redirects the riders' attentions back to their journey, Hagrid's new pet Hungarian Horntail Dragon (which he lost, as per rumours told by the paintings and \"students\" alike) ironically begins to chase the riders. The bench flies out of the projection screen and into a set of the uneven bridge that runs over the valley behind Hogwarts and, after falling out of a hole in the floor of the bridge, riders encounter an audio-animatronic dragon, which breathes fake fire at them. As Hermione attempts to help the riders away from the Acromantulas (using Arania Exumai) and towards the castle (encountering many spiders on the way), they run into an audio-animatronic Whomping Willow which swipes at them, conveniently knocking them onto the Quidditch pitch. As Slytherin scores in Gryffindor's goal, Dementors begin to arrive at the Quidditch pitch, and Harry attempts to lead the riders away, through the structure of the Pitch, and back to the school, but their bench falls into the long-abandoned Chamber of Secrets through the cave entrance in a cliff through which Harry, Ron, Ginny, Fawkes, and Gilderoy Lockhart departed from the Chamber in the second Harry Potter instalment."

Giants average between twenty and twenty five feet in height; a notable exception was Grawp, who was considered small at only sixteen feet. Giants were not as intelligent as wizards and witches, but definitely more so than trolls, given that they seemed to be able to comprehend magic and are actually fond of its use (provided it isn't being used against them, of course). When breeding, they pride themselves on having large babies, and disappointment would arise if the child was smaller than expected. Unfortunately, most giants did not have the patience for long discussions and seem to prefer simplifying matters by killing their audience if the topic they brought proved too complicated. Because of this, it was imperative that one must have had gifts at the ready when trying to appease giants and take one's time, giving the giants the privilege of deciding what to do with what was offered. Due to their lack of patience for resolving disputes verbally, they were not used to being cramped in small areas, and would fight against each other over the smallest matters, such as sleeping places and food. Even being a Gurg does not guarantee the complete loyalty of the tribe, as others may end up killing them to obtain the position, such as when Golgomath killed Karkus, summarising their characteristics of might makes right.

In Britain, for example, the Aurors were trained to investigate crimes related to the Dark Arts, and to apprehend or detain dark wizards and witches. When working for the Major Investigation Department, Aurors used a number of magical tools and devices such as the Real-Time Hex Indicator map and the USA Spell Contraventions map to track down illegal or especially flamboyant use of magic that could pose a threat to the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy. Also, unlike their British counterpart, the American Aurors were divided into several divisions around North America to keep the peace, as opposed to all working within the same one. Aurors were, essentially, the wizarding world equivalent of police officers and military (as they served in both roles for wizardkind). According to Minerva McGonagall, no Auror had been taken on by the Ministry of Magic for three years prior to 1995, though Nymphadora Tonks stated that she qualified the year before, meaning she was probably one of the last candidates taken on. The head of the British Auror Office (as of 2007) was Harry Potter, but he left to become Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement by 2019.

The castle was built in the late Early Middle Ages (c. 993) by a wizard architect and the four most celebrated wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. The castle was the main building of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, regarded as the finest wizarding school in the world. It was the setting of the final battle of the Second Wizarding War, the Battle of Hogwarts, which resulted in the deaths of several witches and wizards who fought in defence of the castle, including Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Fred Weasley, Colin Creevey, Lavender Brown, and Severus Snape. The castle was badly damaged in the battle, but ultimately the Order of the Phoenix won when Harry Potter defeated his nemesis, Lord Voldemort, in the Great Hall. Due to its extremely advanced age and the sheer amount of magic present in or around it, the castle was implied to have developed some form of sentience or awareness, such as when it sealed the Headmaster's Tower against Dolores Umbridge in 1996, and the various trick steps and false doors. The castle was supported by magic (unable to be maintained or constructed by any other means), a good example being the moving staircases, a feature contributed by one of the four Hogwarts founders, Rowena Ravenclaw. Hogwarts was also protected by numerous ancient spells, such as the Anti-Disapparition Jinx; this could, however, be overridden by the Headmaster (and Dumbledore's phoenix, Fawkes) when necessary. It was also unplottable and bewitched so that, if Muggles approached the castle, all they would see would be a mouldering ruin with a sign warning them to keep out and that it was unsafe. The protective magic over Hogwarts was not only strong enough to apparently resist the dispelling effects of the Taboo, but also to repel even talented Dark Wizards."

Coincidentally, Davis also appeared in the 1989 TV miniseries Prince Caspian and the Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Along with Bjelac and Jim Broadbent, Davis is one of only three actors to have appeared in both the Harry Potter and Narnia franchises. (Of these, Davis and Bjelac were the only two to appear in the same Narnia film.) In 2006, Davis guest-starred in an episode of the comedy series Extras, in an episode in which Daniel Radcliffe, played himself, performed a spoof of Harry Potter; Davis (also appearing as himself) played a magical creature in the spoof. He also guest-starred in the episode \"The Eye of the Phoenix\" on BBC's Merlin as the mystical Grettir, gatekeeper to the land of the Fisher King."

An object that had a lasting charm placed on it was called bewitched, though charms, in general, appeared to last longer than other spells. The Fidelius Charm, for example, could completely concealed a person or a place in such a way that no one could find them unless they were given the location by a Secret Keeper. Memory Charms could be so strong that they completely removed a person's memory or even damaged his or her mind permanently, (while the Silencing Charm had to be recast monthly on the Fwooper and the Disillusionment Charm had be performed daily on Hippogriffs and Winged horses). The Amplifying Charm (Sonorus) was a charm that could be used to amplify the targeted sound, be it a person's voice or a piece of equipment. The Anti-Alohomora Charm (incantation unknown) was an anti-unlocking spell, that acted as a counter-charm to the Unlocking Charm."

  "summary": "The Water-Making Spell, also known as the Aguamenti Charm (Aguamenti) was a charm that conjured a jet of clean, drinkable water from the tip of the caster's wand. This spell, in addition to being a charm, can also be classified as conjuration, an advanced form of Transfiguration. The Water-Making spell also appeared to be the opposite of the Fire-Making Spell, which was used to conjure flames instead. This spell was taught at N.E.W.T.-level in Charms class at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, to sixth years. Depending on the caster's concentration and intentions, this charm can be anything from a simple jet of water to a wave. This spell was useless against Fiendfyre, a spell that conjured cursed flames, as the water conjured from this spell would instantly evaporate on contact with the dark fire. In both Spanish and Portuguese, \"agua\"/\"\u00e1gua\" means \"water\" and \"mente\" (also in Italian) means \"mind\"; these derive from the Latin terms \"aqua\" (\"water\") and \"mens\" (\"mind\"), the latter's singular dative case rendered as \"menti\" (\"to the mind\" or \"for the mind\"). Given J. K. Rowling's love of puns, it would also seem plausible that there might have been a hybrid of \"\u00e1gua\" and \"augment\", in the sense of \"increase\", in her mind."

At some point after this, the Magical Maintenance Department installed a set of enchanted windows in the room, which they bewitched so that when the Department changed the weather in it, all the other enchanted windows on the premises would change accordingly. When the students arrived at the Ministry, they were made to report to the All-Purpose Room for orientation, which included a review of the Rules of Conduct for Students Visiting the Ministry of Magic before the handing out of the recquired credentials permitting them limited, supervised access to designated areas elsewhere at the Ministry."

The Disarming Charm became Harry Potter's signature spell, and it notably caused the death of Lord Voldemort during the Battle of Hogwarts by rebounding his Killing Curse because the Elder Wand recognised Harry as its master through the spell connection, and thus strengthened the Disarming Charm to the point that Voldemort's Killing Curse backfired on himself. The Disarming Charm caused whatever an opponent was holding at the time, usually a wand, to fly high out of their hand.

This spell needed thought behind it, and the object must be clear in the caster's mind before trying to summon it. This spell's most famous use was, according to Miranda Goshawk, by the Accionites and their leader, Gideon Flatworthy. In the traditional wizarding tale \"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\" from The Tales of Beedle the Bard, the son of the titular pot's original owner summoned a lost donkey belonging to one of his fellow villagers.

Greyback, although he was not branded with the Dark Mark, became the most integrated into the Death Eaters out of the werewolf community. Greyback, though permitted to wear Death Eater robes, was treated with very little respect among the true Death Eaters, who would not hesitate to attack him if he steps out of his bounds, a fact he was painfully aware of. Because of his membership of the Order of the Phoenix, Remus Lupin was sent under Albus Dumbledore's orders to integrate himself into the underground werewolf community to serve as a spy for the Order. However, his attempt to live among the magical community made it difficult for him to gain the army's trust. Upon Voldemort successfully conquering the Ministry, the werewolf army became more active, becoming Snatchers to capture Muggle-borns and insurgents for reward money. Upon Voldemort's defeat, Greyback was defeated by Ron Weasley and Neville Longbottom, and either captured or killed as a result, thus leaving the army's status unknown."

The penalty for the use of this curse on another human being was a life sentence in Azkaban, unless there was sufficient enough evidence that the caster did so under the influence of the Imperius Curse or for defensible reasons. The two most well-known victims of this curse are former Aurors Alice and Frank Longbottom: the Longbottoms were tortured into insanity with it by Death Eaters Bellatrix, Rodolphus, Rabastan Lestrange, and Barty Crouch Jnr. The Cruciatus Curse was deemed by the Ministry to be dark magic, and, along with the Imperius and Killing curses, were declared \"unforgivable\" in 1717. The use of any of these three curses on a fellow human being would result in a life sentence in Azkaban without parole (unless there was sufficient evidence that the caster did so under the influence of the Imperius Curse or for other defensible reasons). Many Secret Keepers in the past have been subjected to the Cruciatus and Imperius Curses in an attempt to learn the secrets they keep, but to no avail as the Keeper must reveal it willingly.

After seeing the love Fleur Delacour held for Bill Weasley despite his injuries, she publicly declared her love for Remus. Tonks became pregnant by this time and Remus began to worry that he had passed on his werewolf condition to their son, though this proved not to be the case as the child had inherited only Tonks' metamorphic abilities.

A mixture of powdered silver and dittany applied to a fresh bite would seal the wound and allow the victim to live on as a werewolf, although tragic tales were told of knowing victims begging for death rather than becoming werewolves. The Wolfsbane Potion, invented by Damocles Belby, allowed werewolf drinkers to keep their human mind during transformation. A werewolf could not choose whether or not to transform and would no longer remember who they were, and would kill even their best friend given the opportunity once transformed. Lycanthropy was a magical illness known to be spread by contact between saliva and blood; thus, when a transformed werewolf bit a human, the bitten would become a werewolf themselves. Most Muggles, however, would die from the extent of their injuries in the instance of a werewolf attack as noted by Professor Marlowe Forfang, though some could survive to become werewolves themselves. Were a werewolf in human form when they bit their victim, the victim would merely gain lupine tendencies such as a fondness for rare meat. Any bite or scratch obtained from a werewolf, whether in human or animal form, would leave permanent scars. The only known human born to at least one werewolf parent (untransformed at time of conception) was Teddy Lupin, son of werewolf Remus and human metamorphmagus Nymphadora Tonks."

More advanced Occlumency involved suppressing only the thoughts, emotions, and memories that would contradict whatever it was an Occlumens wished a Legilimens to believe, producing a \"faux\" layer of mentality that could totally throw off the perspective of one who used Legilimency into thinking that the said layer being the legitimate one whilst its bona fide counterpart lay deeper within; hence, it was not obvious that Occlumency was being used even if the person was lying.

In the 1995\u20131996 school year, Albus Dumbledore had Severus Snape teach Harry Potter Occlumency in an effort to prevent his mind from being penetrated and influenced by Lord Voldemort. Snape was a highly skilled Occlumens, being able to successfully deceive extremely accomplished Legilimens Voldemort, but his lessons with Harry were ultimately unsuccessful."

  "summary": "Dursley was the surname of a Muggle family, the only known living close relatives of Harry Potter. Petunia Dursley (n\u00e9e Evans) was the older sister of Harry's mother, Lily Potter (n\u00e9e Evans), but took the surname Dursley when she married Vernon Dursley. Petunia Evans, forever embittered by the fact that her parents seemed to value her magical sister more than they valued her, left Cokeworth forever to pursue a typing course in London. This led to an office job, where she met the extremely unmagical, opinionated, and materialistic Vernon Dursley. He had a perfectly correct car, and wanted to do completely ordinary things, and by the time he had taken her on a series of dull dates, during which he talked mainly about himself and his predictable ideas on the world. As she had expected, Vernon was quite shocked, though he comforted her and told her it was not her fault for having a \"freak\" for a sister and that he would not hold it against her. He finally proposed to her in his mother's (very ordinary) living room, it was all very emotional. Due to Petunia's maternal connection to Harry Potter, he was sent to live with the Dursleys after his parents were murdered by Lord Voldemort. The belief was that the power of Lily's loving sacrifice for Harry would be continued through Petunia, due to her blood connection with her sister, even though she personally held Harry in contempt."

James was named in honour of his paternal grandfather and his father's godfather (James Potter and Sirius Black). A few days before the match, his father introduced him and his younger brother Albus to the Bulgarian National Quidditch team Seeker, and an old associate of his father, Viktor Krum. James along with the rest of his family, with the exception of his mother (who was in the journalists' enclosure) and Albus (who was wearing Brazilian green), sported Bulgarian red. James laughed when Albus almost toppled out of the VIP box cheering when Gon\u00e7alo Flores scored the first goal of the game, but his uncle Ron grabbed the back of his robes and saved him. Due to James laughing, Daily Prophet correspondent Rita Skeeter (who was covering the match live with Ginny) suggested that he may have pushed Albus. James first started attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on 1 September, 2015, and was Sorted into Gryffindor House, to nobody's surprise and Teddy Lupin's disappointment. Two years later, James was seen going to Hogwarts with Albus on 1 September 2017, who was just starting his first year."

 "gun": {

  "summary": "A gun, also known as a firearm, is a type of metallic weapon commonly crafted and used by non-magic people, that operate by firing projectiles using explosive force. Guns are used by a variety of organisations including military and police agencies, and by individuals to hunt and for self-defence. They can come in a variety of configurations, including but not limited to: pistols, rifles, shotguns and cannons. In the 18th century, soon after Dorcus Twelvetrees revealed the secret adresses of Ilvermorny and the MACUSA Headquarters to a scourer descendant; Bartholomew Barebone and a band of gun-wielding friends plotted to kill all wizards and witches living in the area. However, the people were in fact No-Majs unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. In 1876, Rancorous Carpe attempted to trap Peeves and have him removed from Hogwarts Castle via an elaborate trap, of which include a blunderbuss and a miniature cannon. In 1926, No-Maj officers of the New York Police Department, were armed with pump-action shotguns, revolvers, and sub-machine guns. At some point in or prior to 1991, Dudley Dursley swapped a pet parrot for a real, live air rifle at his school. However by summer 1991, the rifle was discarded in his second bedroom, as Dudley had bent the end of it by sitting on it."

 "peeves": {

  "summary": "Peeves was a poltergeist at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, since c. 993. Fond of mischief and chaos, he was a constant pain to the school and its inhabitants, especially Argus Filch, the caretaker, as the only ones able to control him were the Bloody Baron and Albus Dumbledore. In 1995, Peeves, along with most of the Hogwarts residents, opposed Dolores Umbridge, the High Inquisitor, and pranked her until she skedaddled at the end of the school year. In 1998, Peeves fought at the Battle of Hogwarts against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. After the Second Wizarding War, Peeves continued making trouble at Hogwarts. Peeves has wrought havoc upon Hogwarts for centuries, and was often the cause of ire for various teachers and staff. Starting with Hankerton Humble, who was appointed by the Founders themselves, Peeves has traditionally been a pet peeve of every caretaker the school has seen. In 1876, caretaker Rancorous Carpe devised an \"elaborate trap\" in an effort to remove Peeves from the Castle. The trap comprised a bait of assortment of weapons and a vast enchanted bell jar, reinforced by various Containment Charms, which he intended to drop over the poltergeist once he was in place. This did not go as planned, as Peeves easily broke through the bell jar and was left armed with several cutlasses, crossbows, a blunderbuss and a miniature cannon."

 "nonmagic people": {
  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/No-Maj",
  "summary": "Non-magic people, commonly known as Muggles in Great Britain, No-Maj(e)s in the United States, among other names (see below), were humans who were born to two non-magical parents and were incapable of performing magic. Non-magic people were not to be confused with Squibs, who also lacked magic but were born to at least one magical parent. Most non-magic people had been unaware that magic and the wizarding world existed since the establishment of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy in 1692, as wizards had organised their own society largely separate from the Non-magic world. Since the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy was enacted in 1692, wizards and witches had hidden the existence of magic from Muggles. Wizards and witches hid their world with Muggle-Repelling Charms, and if a Muggle witnessed a magical event or saw a magical creature such as a dragon, their memories were erased. Violations of the Statute of Secrecy were prosecuted by the Improper Use of Magic Office, and the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office tried to keep bewitched items away from Muggles. Given the lack of Muggle awareness of the wizarding world, in accordance with the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy of 1692, it can be presumed that the Muggle Liaison Office fulfilled its duties in a very one-sided manner. Wizards and witches thus organised their own society, known as the wizarding world, distinct from that of Muggles. There were some exclusively magical settlements, such as Hogsmeade, but also magical communities hidden within largely Muggle ones, such as in Ottery St Catchpole and even in London."

  "summary": "Descended from one of the Scourers who escaped justice, he had an intense hatred of witches and wizards, and his desire to expose the existence of the wizarding world propelled one of the largest ever breaches of the International Statute of Secrecy. Although no one in his family was magical, he was descended from one of the Scourers who married No-Majs and assimilated into non-magic society in order to escape punishment for their crimes, and, as such, had an intense belief in the existence of magic and the inherent evilness of witches and wizards. Feigning innocent interest, Bartholomew plied Dorcus with questions and was thereby able to extract information about the wizarding world from her. She readily told him the locations of both Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the headquarters of the Magical Congress of the United States of America, as well as details about the International Confederation of Wizards and the manners in which wizards endeavoured to hide their world. After getting as much information out of Dorcus as possible, Bartholomew stole her wand she had obligingly demonstrated for him. He showed Dorcus's wand to as many newspaper reporters as he could, and some of them took him seriously enough to publish pictures of it, describing how it \"had a kick like a mule\" when waved. Not satisfied with simply making his fellow No-Majs aware of the existence of the wizarding world, Bartholomew banded together with some gun-wielding friends, and set out to persecute and kill all witches and wizards who lived in the area."

 "daily prophet": {

  "summary": "The Daily Prophet was a wizarding newspaper based in London, England and was the primary source of news for British and Irish wizards. Because of the newspaper's ability to influence the minds of many in the British and Irish wizarding communities, it had been known to print slanted-content at the request of the British Ministry of Magic, in an effort to publicise the Ministry's preferred version of ongoing events and political agendas. Unfortunately, the Prophet did not seem to have a lot of journalistic integrity, as it had been known to be more concerned about sales than the factual accuracy and reporting of ongoing events. The paper featured a morning and evening edition, the latter of which was called the Evening Prophet. As news changed, an edition might magically change, too, over the course of the day, probably by means of a Protean Charm. There was only one wizarding newspaper in Britain, discounting such small circulation publications such as The Quibbler. The Daily Prophet, whose headquarters were in Diagon Alley, was delivered by owl on a daily basis to nearly every wizarding household in Britain. Occasionally (when something particularly interesting or exciting happened, such as the illegal flight of a Ford Anglia the length of Britain) an Evening Prophet edition would be rushed out. The Prophet was not the only publication in wizarding Britain, but it was almost certainly the most widely read."

When Harry was pushed out of the way, and then unintentionally made the glass disappear, Piers and Dudley jumped back in surprise. When Piers told the Dursleys that Harry had been talking to the snake, they gave Harry his longest ever punishment.

The Sorting Hat originally belonged to Godric Gryffindor, one of the four founders of Hogwarts. During the opening banquet at the beginning of each school year, the first-year students were lined up and their names read aloud alphabetically. The hat was battered and old by 1991; it was patched, frayed, and extremely dirty. It spoke to the wearer inside of the hat with a small, quiet voice, using Legilimency to interpret their thoughts and respond to them. After a time of consideration, the hat announced its choice aloud for all to hear, and the student joined the selected house. On those occasions when Slytherins behaved altruistically or selflessly, when Ravenclaws flunked all their exams, when Hufflepuffs proved lazy yet academically gifted, and when Gryffindors exhibited cowardice, the Hat steadfastly backed its original decision. On balance, however, the Hat had made remarkably few errors of judgement over the many centuries it had been at work."

Ron also jokingly told her to beat Draco Malfoy's son, Scorpius, in every test, though Hermione expressed a more tolerant attitude. Ron also warned Rose not to get too friendly with Scorpius, quipping that her grandfather, Arthur Weasley, would never forgive her for marrying a pure-blood. Later, while on board the train, Albus and Rose wandered around the train looking for a compartment to sit in. Rose reminded Albus that their parents met on the train, so finding the right compartment to sit in was very important as they too could meet their lifelong friends here. Opening the door to one compartment, Albus and Rose found Scorpius Malfoy sitting alone with sweets and introduced themselves to him.

The colour of the Salamander depended on the heat of its birthing fire, and produces hot flames itself. The maximum number of hours a salamander could survive out of fire as well as the number of legs most salamanders had was six, and as such, salamanders were used in the runic alphabet to represent the number six. In October 1992, Fred and George Weasley once experimented with feeding fireworks to a salamander, which caused it to rocket around the room, emitting tangerine stars. In January 1994, Professor Rubeus Hagrid taught his third year Care of Magical Creatures class about these beasts, providing his class with a \"bonfire\" full of them, with students very much enjoying his lesson, collecting dry wood and leaves to keep their fire blazing while the salamanders scampered up and down the burning logs.

  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald",
  "summary": "Gellert Grindelwald (c. 1883 \u2013 March 1998) was a wizard who was considered to be among the most powerful and dangerous Dark Wizards of all time, second only to Lord Voldemort. He was amongst the greatest wizards to have ever lived, often considered to be the third most powerful wizard in history, his only superiors being Tom Riddle and Albus Dumbledore. After leaving Durmstrang, he fostered a romantic relationship with a young Albus Dumbledore, making plans to find the Deathly Hallows and lead a Wizarding revolution to end the International Statute of Secrecy, creating a benevolent global hierarchical order led by wise and powerful witches and wizards that dominated Muggles. At seventeen, their partnership fell apart after the two were involved in a three-way duel with Dumbledore's brother Aberforth that resulted in the death of Dumbledore's sister Ariana. Grindelwald left Britain and later stole the Elder Wand from Mykew Gregorovitch, proceeding alone with the revolution he and Dumbledore had planned. Gellert Grindelwald was born around 1882 or 1883, and was educated at Durmstrang Institute during his formative years, where he excelled in various fields of magic and absorbed much of the school's strength-obsessed, Dark Magic-oriented culture. At some point in his youth, Grindelwald, who was a natural born Seer, had a vision where he saw himself rise to dominance over the wizarding world, and when he learned of the fabled Deathly Hallows; three fabled objects which, if united, would make the possessor the Master of Death, he quickly came to see the Quest as instrumental to fulfil the aforementioned prediction. Over the course of his school career, Grindelwald grew increasingly obsessed with learning whatever he could about the three items in question, to the point of appropriating the runic symbol that represented them as his own personal emblem; and even engraved it on the walls of Durmstrang prior to his departure."

  "summary": "The Niffler was a magical beast with a long snout and a coat of black, fluffy fur. They were attracted to shiny things, which made them wonderful for locating treasure, but that also meant that they could wreak havoc if kept (or set loose) indoors. Students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry learnt about Nifflers in Care of Magical Creatures class, an elective that could be chosen in the third year of their education. Nifflers were rodent-like creatures with a long snout similar to that of a platypus and a coat of black, fluffy fur. Native to Britain, they lived in burrows as deep as twenty feet below ground, and females produced six to eight young in a single litter. Nifflers had a pouch on their bellies which held far more than at first seemed possible, like the effects of an Undetectable Extension Charm on a container. However, they could destroy belongings looking for sparkly objects, and for that reason it was inadvisable to keep them as a house pet. It was also implied that they could turn vicious if provoked, as the second Niffler released into Dolores Umbridge's office apparently tried to take a chunk out of her leg. Newt Scamander owned a Niffler, which escaped twice from his suitcase during his visit to New York in 1926 and tried to rob both the Steen National Bank and a jewel shop of numerous valuables."

When Harry Potter befriended Arthur and Molly Weasley's youngest son, Ronald Weasley, the Weasleys became a second family to Harry. The Weasleys (unlike many other pure-blood families) willingly associated with Muggles, Muggle-borns, and half-bloods and do not consider themselves superior to others because of their blood status. Thus, elitist pure-blood families such as the Malfoys and the Blacks consider them \"blood traitors\" and treat them with disdain; Cedrella Black was even disowned by her family for marrying Septimus Weasley. The Weasleys tended to have large numbers of children; an unusual trait for wizarding families, according to Draco Malfoy. Ron's generation of Weasleys were considered poor by wizarding standards; their vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank only contained a small pile of Sickles and a single Galleon as of 1992."

Bill Weasley thought she was very beautiful, and she impressed him in their Defence Against the Dark Arts class when she single-handedly used the Stunning Spell and defeated a group of vampire bats. Bill asked Jacob's sibling for advice, but was very nervous about approaching Emily because he had never been in love before. Jacob's sibling eventually agreed to speak to Emily for him, and she was very surprised by the news. Emily wanted to hear everything, and when she found out that he was very shy, she called him \"a prat\" and insulted the Weasley family by wondering who would ever date one, even if they were good-looking. In the 1987\u20131988 school year, Emily wanted to run the Celestial Ball decorating committee, and supposedly spread false rumours about her fellow competitor, Penny Haywood, in the attempts of hurting their chance of winning. In the 1988\u20131989 school year, when Ismelda Murk bumped into Emily and refused to apologise, Emily got hold of her diary and proceeded to read it aloud, mocking Ismelda for having a crush on Barnaby Lee and publicly humiliating her in front of many others. She was present in the Great Hall when Jacob's sibling, Nymphadora Tonks, Tulip Karasu and Jae Kim unleashed jinxed Ever-Bashing Boomerangs. Emily was a very haughty, narcissistic, and contemptuous young woman with clearly a very high opinion of herself, who seemed to exemplify the more negative stereotypes of Gryffindors."

Antioch was said to have possessed the Elder Wand, though beyond Dumbledore's theory that he had crafted it himself and the story saying he had been murdered in his sleep for it, the exact circumstances of this are unknown. In the The Tale of the Three Brothers, the Peverell brothers are described as having received the Hallows from Death himself, after using their magical talents to cross a treacherous river that would have assuredly killed them otherwise, and Antioch, for his prize, asked for \"a wand more powerful than any other in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death!\" and so Death crossed to an Elder tree on the banks of the river, made a wand from a branch, and gave it to Antioch. Leaving his enemy dead, Antioch lodged in an inn to celebrate, where he drunkenly boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched \"from Death himself\", and of how it made him invincible. That night, as he slept, another wizard crept upon him, stole the wand, and slit his throat to make sure Antioch was unable to come after the thief afterwards. Following his death, Antioch was laid to rest in the churchyard by the Parish Church of St. Clementine, in Godric's Hollow, along with his brothers Cadmus and Ignotus. Antioch was a distant relative of both Tom Marvolo Riddle and Harry Potter, as each was descended from one of his brothers, Cadmus Peverell and Ignotus Peverell respectively. According to The Tale of the Three Brothers, Antioch was a man who desired beyond everything to be an all powerful wizard."

During Altheda's life, her home, money, and wand had all been stolen by an Evil sorcerer, leaving her to wallow in poverty and despair. After completing three trials, Altheda arrived at the Fountain with her companions: Asha, Amata, and Sir Luckless. However, before the four could decide who would get to bathe in the Fountain, Asha collapsed from exhaustion. The potion not only saved Asha's life but also cured her of the malady she suffered, which she had believed only the Fountain could heal. In curing Asha's disease, Altheda realised that she had the means to earn a comfortable living through selling potions as a potioneer, and therefore had no need to bathe in the Fountain. In the beginning of the story, Altheda was portrayed as an open and compassionate woman who could empathise with the misfortunes of others, as seen by how she, Asha, and Amata became good friends through sharing their tales of woe and even came to the agreement that they would unite and try to reach the Fountain together if they had the opportunity to. However, Altheda could also be a realist, which may make her seem ungenerous in a way, especially given how she became angry with Amata for accidentally bringing along Sir Luckless with them on their quest, and only changed her mind when Amata herself became angry with Sir Luckless and scolded him into helping them on their journey. Later on, as the four were forced to encounter the numerous obstacles of the Enchanted Garden, one could see more positive qualities in Altheda: true courage, steely determination, and even selflessness for the sake of friendship."

According to The Tale of the Three Brothers, it was the first Hallow created, supposedly made by Death himself. According to legend, whoever united the wand with the other two Hallows (the Resurrection Stone and the Cloak of Invisibility) would become the Master of Death. It was said to have been the most powerful wand that had ever existed, able to perform feats of magic that would normally be impossible even for the most skilled wizards, such as mending another wand damaged beyond normal magical repair. The Elder Wand's core was the tail hair of a Thestral, a potent yet tricky substance to master; only a witch or wizard who was capable of accepting death could do so. According to The Tale of the Three Brothers (as compiled in The Tales of Beedle the Bard), three brothers \u2014 suspected to be Antioch, Cadmus, and Ignotus Peverell \u2014 were out travelling when they came to a treacherous river that had been known to claim the lives of many that had attempted to cross it."

  "summary": "Most spells were cast with the aid of wands, but spells could be cast without the use of wands. Although wandless magic was more common in other countries, such as Africa, European wizards were generally used to using the tool and found wandless magic more difficult, requiring much more concentration and skill. Some magical creatures such as house elves and goblins were known to perform such magic and, in fact, were forbidden to carry wands. Wands were manufactured and sold by wandmakers, the most famous of these in Great Britain being Ollivander, and in Eastern Europe Gregorovitch. Although the wand cores might come from the same creature, or the wood might come from the same tree, no two existing wands were exactly alike. Wands were developed in Europe at an unknown point, though it is known that it was in the B.C. In the 13th century, the Elder Wand, which would become known as the most powerful wand in existence, was created."

He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was sorted into Slytherin house, like most members of the House of Black. At some point, he married his second cousin Walburga Black. The two lived in their family home at 12 Grimmauld Place in London, England. Orion and his wife, like many members of the Black family, believed strongly in blood purity. Their older son Sirius disagreed with their bigotry, and when he was about sixteen, he ran away from home rather than remain with the family. Sirius moved in with the Potter family, and in retaliation, Walburga burned his name off the family tapestry. Orion and Walburga favoured their younger son, Regulus, who echoed their belief system, and they approved when he joined the Death Eaters."

After Dumbledore's death in 1997, everyone in whom he confided the location of 12 Grimmauld Place to became a Secret-Keeper, so headquarters was moved to the Burrow. At some point, an early member of the wizarding House of Black coveted the beautiful house and managed to \"persuade\" the original Muggle occupant to leave, and put the appropriate spells on it. The house was, apparently, in the Black family for some generations when Walburga Black took possession in the mid-20th century. Upon Walburga\u2019s death in 1985, the house passed to her only living descendant, Sirius, who, though he had been blasted off the family tree, had apparently not been disinherited. Since Sirius was in Azkaban, the house sat empty for ten years with only Kreacher, who had gone \u201cround the twist,\u201d to look after it. Walburga Black made her disgust of having anyone less than pure-blood in her home very clear through the hostile shrieks of her portrait, which was affixed to the wall with a Permanent Sticking Charm. The Black family tree shows that both of Sirius's grandfathers, Arcturus Black III and Pollux Black, survived Walburga by several years, as did his unmarried great-aunt Cassiopeia, so they must have lived elsewhere."

While many are content with simply remaining separate from Muggle society, some believe that the world would be a better place with wizards in charge. The original tale portrayed Muggles favourably, but when relations with them worsened in a later century, the tale was changed to contain anti-Muggle propaganda. They thought they were finer and more nobler than people without magic, mainly because they were capable of using magic for everything. They would refuse to lift, carry or move anything without using magic. Along with his friend, Albus Dumbledore, he wanted to end the Statute of Secrecy and rule the Muggles \"for the greater good\". However, Albus later drastically changed his views following the tragic death of his sister, Ariana Dumbledore, in a duel started by himself, his brother Aberforth and Grindelwald, the latter who fled afterwards. Grindelwald started a wizarding war and evaded capture for many years, until Dumbledore stopped and defeated him for good in a second legendary duel in 1945."

Despite the mouse's diminutive size, it shone with a brilliant light, bringing the Dementors to a halt as it nimbly moved through the ranks of fleeing villagers. Enraged, Raczidian decided to enter the fray himself, and tried to summon a Patronus to ward off Illyius's mouse. However, he failed to remember that only the pure of heart can produce a Patronus and thus, for the first time in history, it was revealed what happens when a competent, but unworthy wizard or witch attempts the spell; maggots shot out of Raczidian's wand and quickly devoured him as they engulfed his entire body."

They used this to their advantage when marketing their line of protective clothing (hats, cloaks, gloves), upon which permanent Shield Charms were cast. The Shield Charm's origins are unknown, but was in use by the 15th century. The most famous use of the charm took place in 1484, in the town of Poppleton, where the tyrannical Earl of Paunchley held a jousting match. The Earl wouldn't hear of anyone staying home, so he dragged Edmund and his mother to the castle, and said the mother had to watch while her child was tied to a horse and forced to compete in the jousting.

With the deaths of Fabian and Gideon in the First Wizarding War, the status of the Prewett family is unknown, though it continued in the female line through the children of Molly Weasley. Some members of the Prewett family would likely have been labelled \"blood traitors\", as they were members of the Order of the Phoenix and did not believe in the ideology of blood purity. However, the attitude of the prejudiced House of Black towards the Prewetts suggests that not all members were considered blood traitors. Lucretia Black was not disowned for marrying Ignatius Prewett, implying that the Prewetts were more accepted in elite pure-blood circles than a family like the Weasleys."

Veela were the mascots for the Bulgarian National Quidditch team during the 1994 Quidditch World Cup, which indicates an Eastern European origin. However, the part-Veela Delacour family were from France, suggesting that they could be found all over Europe. Veela were described as looking like incredibly beautiful women, with moon-bright skin and white-gold hair that fanned out behind them, despite the absence of wind. When Veela became angry, however, they transformed into something more like Harpies \u2014 their faces turned into cruel-beaked bird-like heads, while long scaly wings burst from their shoulders, and they could launch balls of fire from their hands. For example, in the 1994 Quidditch World Cup, they were easily wound up by the Leprechauns, resulting in a fight between both teams' mascots on the pitch. Veela hair was a magical substance, suitable as a core for wand crafting."

 "blood status": {
  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_Status",
  "summary": "Blood status, also called purity of blood, was a concept in the wizarding world that distinguished between family trees that had different levels of magically-endowed members. As Sirius Black informed Harry Potter, almost all wizards of their time had Muggles in their family trees, though some claimed not to. In wizarding Britain, they were allowed to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, although some other schools, such as Durmstrang Institute, did not admit Muggle-borns. Those with prejudice against Muggles and their families often referred to such wizards as \"Mudbloods\", a highly offensive term implying that the individual had dirty and inferior blood. Those who discriminated against Muggle-borns believed that they did not deserve magic and should be excluded from the wizarding world, in spite of the fact that Muggle-borns were just as magically talented as those of other blood statuses. When the British Ministry of Magic fell under the indirect control of Lord Voldemort during the Second Wizarding War, it began distributing propaganda against \"Mudbloods\" under the authorship of Dolores Umbridge. Muggle-borns were also forced to register with the Ministry's Muggle-Born Registration Commission, which accused Muggle-borns of having stolen their wands and sentenced them to Azkaban. Due to the dominance of the magic gene, children born to at least one magical parent would usually be magical themselves."

The ICWQC was an international regulatory body, subject to the International Confederation of Wizards, that oversaw international Quidditch competitions, such as the World Cup. It was also the ICWQC that chose the referees for World Cup matches.<\nThe rulebook concerning both on-and-off pitch magic was alleged to stretch to nineteen volumes and to include such rules as \u2018no dragon is to be introduced into the stadium for any purpose including, but not limited to, team mascot, coach or cup warmer\u2019 and \u2018modification of any part of the referee\u2019s body, whether or not he or she has requested such modification, will lead to a lifetime ban from the tournament and possibly imprisonment.' A watershed moment for the Quidditch World Cup was the implementation of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1692, which was intended to conceal the existence of magic and wizards. The International Confederation of Wizards (ICW) saw the Quidditch World Cup as a security risk of the highest magnitude because of the mass movement and congregation of so many members of the international wizarding community."

At some point between the mid-1970s to the early '80s, a student at Hogwarts by the name of Jacob was involved in a search for the fabled Cursed Vaults, which led to the accidental unleashing of a Sleepwalking curse, which placed students into a deep slumber and caused them to mindlessly wander off into the Forbidden Forest in the direction of one of the Cursed Vaults, where those whom the staff failed to stop where, due to their condition and inability to defend themselves, ravaged and some even outright devoured by the more dangerous and bloodthirsty creatures within.

Although never officially a Death Eater herself, Narcissa believed in the importance of blood purity and supported her husband in following Lord Voldemort during the First and Second Wizarding Wars. Narcissa took necessary measures to protect her family, including lying to Voldemort about Harry Potter being dead during the Battle of Hogwarts, an act which saved the Malfoys from serving time in Azkaban following the Dark Lord's defeat.

The Malfoy family consisted of an ancient line of pure-blood wizards, most of whom attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and were traditionally sorted into Slytherin House. Like many other progenitors of noble English families, the wizard Armand Malfoy arrived in Britain with William the Conqueror as part of the invading Norman army. Having rendered unknown, shady, (and almost certainly magical) services to King William I, Malfoy was given a prime piece of land in Wiltshire, seized from local landowners, upon which his descendants have lived for ten consecutive centuries. Until the passing of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy in 1692, the Malfoys integrated themselves in high-class Muggle society. Though hotly denied by subsequent generations, there is ample evidence to suggest that the first Lucius Malfoy was an unsuccessful aspirant to the hand of Elizabeth I, and some wizarding historians allege that the Queen's subsequent opposition to marriage was due to a jinx placed upon her by the thwarted Malfoy. The Malfoys expanded their already large estate with the lands of their Muggle neighbours, and dabbled successfully into Muggle currency and assets, becoming one of the wealthiest families in wizarding Britain. Though they opposed the Statute of Secrecy at first, they soon embraced it and cut off all ties with Muggle families, denying that they had ever fraternised with such people."

Some rode broomsticks (a difficult feat when carrying trunks and pets); others commandeered enchanted carts and, later, carriages; some attempted to Apparate (often with disastrous effects, as the castle and grounds had always been protected with Anti-Apparition Charms), others rode a variety of magical creatures. In 1827, Ottaline Gambol rose to the office of Minister for Magic, and she made a daring and controversial suggestion to solve the ages-old problem of how to transport hundreds of students to and from Hogwarts Castle every school year without attracting the Muggles' attention. The locomotive for the Hogwarts Express itself was originally built by the Muggle engineers at Crewe, in Cheshire, England, in the early-to-mid 19th century. The morning after this operation, the residents of Hogsmeade awoke to find the gleaming red Hogwarts Express and a Hogsmeade railway station that had not been there previously, and the Muggle railway employees in Crewe had the feeling they had misplaced something, which stayed with them for the rest of the year.

Harry eventually came with his friend Hermione Granger, and the two narrowly escaped death at Voldemort's hands. By late 1997, Harry Potter and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger were searching for the Horcruxes of Lord Voldemort in an attempt to defeat him once and for all. They had obtained Salazar Slytherin's Locket in September by infiltrating the Ministry of Magic, but the negative energy within the locket caused Ron to part company with his friends when they had difficulty deciding what their next move should be. Eventually, Hermione brought up the fact that her copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which Albus Dumbledore left to her in his will, contained a symbol that she recalled Xenophilius Lovegood wearing to the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour that summer. Unsure what that meant, Harry and Hermione turned their focus to going to Godric's Hollow.

A number of wizarding families live there, including Bill and Fleur Weasley, who reside in a house called Shell Cottage on the outskirts of town. It is home to several wizarding families, including the Diggories, Fawcetts, Lovegoods, and Weasleys. Godric's Hollow with its large wizarding population is in the West Country, meaning the area was home to the Dumbledores, Peverells, Potters, Bathilda Bagshot, and many others. As the Sorting Hat once stated that Godric Gryffindor was from wild moor, Godric's Hollow is likely to be located in either Devon or Cornwall. On his Chocolate Frog Card, Nicolas Flamel and his wife Perenelle are said to be enjoying a quiet life in Devon, in the West Country. In the mid-nineties, Magizoologist Newt Scamander and his wife, Porpentina retired to Dorset, also in the West Country. The hiding place where Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter found Horace Slughorn, a village called Budleigh Babberton, is in the West Country as well."

  "summary": "They were popular bedtime stories for centuries, with the result being that The Wizard and the Hopping Pot and The Fountain of Fair Fortune were as familiar to many of the students at Hogwarts, as Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty are to various Muggle children. Beedle's stories resembled Muggle fairy tales in many respects; for instance, virtue was usually rewarded and wickedness punished. In Muggle fairy tales, magic tended to lie at the root of the hero or heroine's troubles \u2014 the wicked witch had poisoned the apple, put the princess into a hundred years' sleep or turned the prince into a hideous beast. In The Tales of Beedle the Bard, on the other hand, we met heroes and heroines who could perform magic themselves, and yet find it just as hard to solve their problems as the Muggle heroes did. Another notable difference between these fables and their Muggle counterparts was that Beedle's witches were much more active in seeking their fortunes than our fairy-tale heroines. The exception to this rule \u2014 the unnamed maiden of 'The Warlock's Hairy Heart' \u2014 acted more like a Muggle's idea of a storybook princess, but there was no happily ever after at the end of her tale. Most of these tales (with the exception of The Warlock's Hairy Heart) had been rewritten by Beatrix Bloxam and compiled into her book The Toadstool Tales, which had since been banned since it had a tendency to induce nausea and vomiting in the children who read, or had to listen to, them. In 1998, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley came to hear the legend: The brothers came to a river which was too deep to wade across, and built a bridge using magic."

Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley enter in the midst of Hermione complaining about an (unheard) joke not making sense. Although Ron thinks the letter comes from the Minister for Magic, Hermione realises it actually comes from the Muggle Prime Minister. Addressed to \"whomever it may concern - as long as they can use magic\", the letter reports on the Queen's handbag being stolen. The letter stresses the urgency of retrieving the handbag as it contains Her Majesty's reading glasses which she needs in order to read her speech at her 80th birthday celebration. Harry suggests Veritaserum could be used to make the thieves confess, but Hermione points out they do not know who the thief is yet. Unable to do it by himself, Ron joins him and together they perform the charm again -- only to have a pile of different lost handbags appear on the table. Neville Longbottom arrives and spots his grandmother's handbag among the litter (Ron asks him if his gran happens to be the Queen)."

An inactive Dark Mark appears as a faint mark on the inner part of the left forearm, similar to that of \"a vivid red tattoo\"; an active one is jet black. Lord Voldemort placed the Dark Mark brand on his followers' inner left forearms both as a sign of their loyalty to him and as a method of summoning them to him when he desired.

Merope exhibited little magical talent in her early years, and as a result was mentally and physically abused by her father, who called her a \"disgusting little Squib\", among other things. However, this was actually a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Merope's magical abilities were suppressed largely because of her father's abuse. It should be noted that a person's magical abilities can be affected by their state of mind, and powerful negative emotions endured on a chronic basis can interfere with or completely drain a person's powers, as Albus Dumbledore pointed out.

Very few books, even those revolving around the Dark Arts, would mention Horcruxes even in the slightest detail: Magick Moste Evile, a book that contained much information of advanced dark arts, barely skimmed the subject of Horcruxes as a subject so evil that it should not be spoken of, showing that even some Dark Wizards were horrified by them. In fact, only one known book, Secrets of the Darkest Art, had detailed information on the method and consequences of creating a Horcrux. No document in existence has information regarding a single individual creating multiple Horcruxes, as no wizard before Voldemort even thought of attempting such a feat; he only dared to when he asked the experienced Horace Slughorn for an expert opinion, under the guise of creating more than one Horcrux in theory. The only known book that provided specific instruction on the creation and nature of a Horcrux was Secrets of the Darkest Art, which was once held in Hogwarts' library (and later in Dumbledore's office).

The son of the Riddles was Tom Riddle Senior, who was bewitched by peasant witch Merope Gaunt with a love spell in 1926, leading to the conception of Tom Marvolo Riddle, who would come to be known as Lord Voldemort. Once Merope removed the love spell, Tom Riddle Senior immediately left and paid no regard to Merope or their unborn son. Voldemort killed his father, paternal grandfather, and grandmother in the house in 1943, and framed his maternal uncle Morfin Gaunt for the crime. After the murder of the Riddles, the house changed hands many times. The only permanent resident during that time period was Frank Bryce, the Riddles' gardener, who was kept on by the house's subsequent owners. In the summer of 1994, after Peter Pettigrew escaped from Hogwarts and found the semi-corporeal Voldemort, the two wizards returned to the Riddle house to plan for Voldemort's return to power.

Nothing is known of Galatea Merrythought's past, although it is likely that she attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and would have purchased her wand from Ollivanders Wand Shop at Diagon Alley at the age of eleven. Merrythought returned to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to teach sometime around 1895, though what subject is unclear. Among her pupils was a young Gryffindor named Albus Dumbledore; other students she taught included Elphias Doge, Aberforth Dumbledore, Horace Slughorn, Theseus Scamander, Newton Scamander, Leta Lestrange, Tom Riddle, and Rubeus Hagrid. The Headmaster during her early years was presumably Professor Phineas Nigellus Black, although she also went on to work under Professor Armando Dippet. Having authored at least two books on the subject (Defence Against the Dark Arts, and Advanced Defence Against the Dark Arts, required reading when Albus Dumbledore was teaching the subject in the 1910s), at an unknown point in her teaching career, certainly between 1927 and 1945, Professor Merrythought became the Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts, taking ownership of Classroom 3C and an office on the sixth floor. Many years later, when Professor Dippet was Headmaster, Galatea became the teacher of a brilliant student named Tom Riddle."

During the 1991\u20131992 school year, Hogwarts Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor Quirinus Quirrell told his students that his turban had been given to him as a gift by an African prince for getting rid of a troublesome zombie. It was eventually revealed that the turban was used to hide the face of Lord Voldemort on the back of Quirrell's head, as he was possessing Quirrell at the time. It is therefore unlikely that Quirrell's story about the zombie was true, and the fact that the native range of zombies is America makes the veracity of the tale regarding the African prince even more dubious.

Performing spells non-verbally was very difficult and required a good deal of practice, as it required concentration and mental discipline alone. Harry Potter noted that several students in his class looked \"like they had received an overdose in U-No-Poo\", (a product of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes that caused constipation), while attempting nonverbal spells. Many wands made from Dogwood were rather noisy, and refused to perform non-verbal magic, whereas wands of Pine were some of the most sensitive to non-verbal magic. Willow wands possessed a well-founded reputation for enabling advanced, non-verbal magic, but of all woods, Alder was known as being the best suited for non-verbal magic. For example, according to Hogwarts nurse Poppy Pomfrey, the unnamed curse that critically injured Hermione Granger during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries might have been fatal had Antonin Dolohov not been silenced when he used it."

So long as the emerald light from the spell lasted, objects such as platforms or doors that had been hidden by Dark magic would be revealed, so that they were temporarily visible and tangible again, until the spell's effects ended. Professor Quirinus Quirrell taught his first year Defence Against the Dark Arts students this spell in the 1991\u20131992 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, something the Ministry of Magic approved of.

  "summary": "They could take many different forms, but were often rendered in a cryptic language that did not allow easy or direct interpretation. Although prophecies often held great importance, they could also cause significant harm if interpreted incorrectly. For example, if a person believed that they were the subject of a prophecy, they could go to great lengths to ensure that it came true (if positive) or take great pains to avoid it (if negative). These efforts could have a ripple effect that could harm innocent bystanders simply for being close to the subject, or if the subject believed those bystanders were obstacles to be overcome in their pursuits. Yet in the end, it could turn out that such efforts were fruitless, since that person was not the true subject of the prophecy in the first place. Although prophecy was considered a form of divination, there were key differences between true prophecy and more traditional \"fortune-telling\" methods such as tea leaf reading, palmistry, or crystal-gazing. Unlike those methods, prophecy had no technical procedures that could be followed, and the art was not even something that could be actively taught or practised. In most cases, a Seer began reciting a prophecy involuntarily, entering into a trance-like state and uttering the words in a distinctly different voice from their own. If Sybill Trelawney's experience was any indication, the Seer was left exhausted afterwards and may not even remember making the prophecy. While some witches and wizards - such as Minerva McGonagall and, to some extent, Albus Dumbledore - harboured a general distrust of divination, true prophecies were not lightly dismissed, even by sceptics."

Hermione Granger strongly disagreed and expressed her opinion in one of Professor Umbridge's Defence Against the Dark Arts classes, which annoyed Umbridge. Although Umbridge was initially impressed that Hermione had read the entire book and was able to quote it, she was quickly irritated when Hermione critiqued the text and coldly deducted points from Gryffindor for \"disrupting her class with pointless interruptions.\" The contents of this book were deemed extremely boring by most students, as Harry Potter compared reading it to listening to the History of Magic teacher, Professor Cuthbert Binns, whose droning was enough to put most students to sleep.

After Rakepick left school, she became a professional Curse-Breaker at Gringotts Wizarding Bank, and her curse-breaking adventures abroad eventually earned her some publicity: her exploits were featured in several newspaper articles and at least one biography was published. She was invited back to the school during the 1987\u20131988 school year by Professor Dumbledore, the school's Headmaster, to help put an end to the threat posed by the Vaults. At the end of the year, she accepted his offer to assume the position of Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor, where she offered more freedom and protection to Jacob's sibling during their search for the remaining Vaults. She manipulated Jacob's sibling to open the Buried Vault, and when Jacob's sibling and their friends discovered the truth, they managed to defeat Rakepick, forcing her to flee Hogwarts. While Professor Albus Dumbledore found her to be an exceptional pupil, she was nevertheless greatly disliked by most of her professors for her rebellious streak, a sentiment that did not improve when she, rather than being a good role model to her younger peers as she grew older, began mentoring them in the art of trouble-making. According to Rubeus Hagrid, during her student years, she was rumoured to be friendly with the Marauders (Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew, Sirius Black, and James Potter), whom Patricia to some extent mentored in mischief-making. At some point in her student years, she asked the Care of Magical Creatures Professor, Silvanus Kettleburn, how to enter the Forbidden Forest without being seen, telling him she meant to explore the forest and study the creatures that dwelled within it, and expressing a desire to become a Magizoologist upon leaving school."

He vacated the office when he was pressured by his colleagues to enter the Chamber of Secrets, to save Ginny Weasley. At this time he stripped down his own office in an attempt to escape, only for Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley to confront him in his office, resulting in him revealing his fraudulence and cowardice, and with Harry disarming of him of his wand when he attempted to erase their memories with the Memory Charm, and Ron throwing it out of the office's open window. During Remus Lupin's time at the school, he filled this office with an assortment of dark creatures, including, on one occasion, a Grindylow in a tank, which was the same day he invited Harry to have tea with him. Four years later in 1997, Lupin would use this as a security question against Harry, after the Battle of the Seven Potters. In 1994, Bartemius Crouch Junior, disguised as Alastor Moody, used this office to store Moody's many Dark Detectors and his magical trunk. When Harry was caught giving a hint to Cedric Diggory, Crouch invited Harry to the office to give him more pointers in dealing with the first task. After Harry returned from Little Hangleton, Barty brought him here to assassinate him, only to be caught by Albus Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall and Severus Snape and the exposure of his true identity, and ultimately received the Dementor's Kiss in this office.

Most people who practised what was known as The Dark Arts were evil, but not all. The Dark Arts commonly referred to spells and actions that could be used to harm others, ranging from the powerful Unforgivable Curses, to brewing harmful or poisonous potions and breeding dark creatures. The most prominent and powerful of these was Lord Voldemort, who was widely considered to be the most evil Dark Wizard in all of history. His followers, known as Death Eaters, also heavily practised the Dark Arts. After engaging in them extensively for many years, even Tom Riddle's appearance demonstrated his corruption \u2014 he lost his former handsomeness, eventually taking on serpentine physical qualities and red eyes. Albus Dumbledore, in particular, suggested that engaging in any of the Dark Arts that involve murder was damaging to the soul; for instance, he told Severus Snape that Draco Malfoy's soul was \"not yet so damaged\" that he was probably capable of murder, but that if he did go through with murder, his soul would be \"ripped apart\". This suggested that using very dark magic, such as the Killing Curse, damaged an individual's soul. Quirinus Quirrell was interested in dark magic, initially by a theoretical view to gain recognition, but his curiosity turned to avarice, and eventually he was completely drawn in and corrupted. According to Snape, the Dark Arts were pragmatic in nature, where every time a branch was defeated, it only came back \"fiercer and cleverer\" than before."

The Thunderbird was known to change colours as it summoned storms, its iridescent feathers shifting from various shades of gold to electrifying blue, to grey and silver, to white, and even to deep navy. Thunderbirds' tail feather could be used as a core in a magic wand, with this type of wand being difficult to master, but powerful and skilled in transfiguration work.

By the 18th century, Crups could be found in the United States, and Thornton Harkaway, President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America in 1760, was a breeder of Crups until his pack savaged several local No-Majs in Williamsburg, Virginia leaving them only able to bark for a period of 48 hours. This lead to Harkaway leaving office in disgrace and the relocation of the Magical Congress of the United States of America headquarters to Baltimore, Maryland. At some point before 1930s, the Crup Sleeping Draught was invented, allowing crups to fall asleep easily. At some point around the late 1980s, the crup had cruppies. Also in the 1980s, Rubeus Hagrid's friend had a litter of cruppies and gave some to Hagrid to take care of."

  "summary": "A fairy was a small, humanoid magical beast with large insect-like wings, which were either transparent or multi-coloured. The fairy was a vain creature, and would often allow itself to be used as decoration by wizardkind. The fairy could not speak; instead, it made a high-pitched buzzing noise to communicate with its fellow fairies, but they were able to laugh in a similar way to the Flitterbies playful buzzing with the wings. Their wings were used as an ingredient in certain potions; removing their wings, while it would not kill them, tended to cause them extreme annoyance, as it did not play to their vanity. Fairies could lay up to fifty eggs in one go, laying them on the underside of leaves. The eggs hatched into brightly coloured larvae, and, at six-to-ten days, they span themselves into a cocoon. Muggles' impression of the fairy was a generous one, having been ingrained into children's minds in the form of \"fairy tales\". Wizards believed that, of all the magical creatures in the world, the fairy, along with the unicorn, had received the best Muggle \"press\". In 1986, Fang found one in the pumpkin patch by Hagrid's Hut and ran away."

  "summary": "A Beast was one of the three classifications used by the British Ministry of Magic to catalogue the various magical creatures that inhabited the wizarding world (the others being Spirit and Being). Loosely defined, a Beast was a magical creature that did not have sufficient intelligence to understand the laws of the magical community, nor bear part of the responsibility in shaping those laws. This definition was laid down by Minister for Magic Grogan Stump in 1811, and the Beast Division was formed as part of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Centaurs and Merpeople both requested to be classified as Beasts, refusing \"Being\" status because they objected to some of the other creatures they would have to share \"Being\" status with, such as Hags and Vampires. Acromantulas, Manticores, the Sphinx and Erklings would have all qualified for Being status since they were capable of intelligent speech, but since they would try to eat any person that goes near them, and were vicious and bloodthirsty, became dangerous when the things they were guarding were threatened, or when they were given the wrong answer to their puzzles or riddles, and would try to eat children and shoot darts at people respectively, they were classified as Beasts."

Its natural curiosity, coupled with a bulletproof hide has led it to repeatedly threaten the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy. The Snallygaster has appeared in Muggle newspapers so often that it competes with the Loch Ness Monster for the title of 'Most Publicity-Hungry Beast.'

Widely regarded as terrifying yet awe-inspiring, they could be found all over the world and were frequently referred to in Asian and medieval European folklore. Able to fly and breathe fire through their nostrils and mouths, they were one of the most dangerous and hardest to conceal creatures in the wizarding world. The British Ministry of Magic classified them as XXXXX, known wizard killers that were impossible to train or domesticate. Despite how dangerous they were, there were people who were trained to work with them, called dragon keepers, or dragonologists. It was a possible, rare corporeal form of the Patronus Charm,\nDragon mothers breathed fire on their eggs to keep them warm. The dragon's first fire breaths, usually accompanied by thick grey smoke, appeared when the dragon was around six months old. However, the ability to fly was normally developed later, at around twelve months, and the dragon would not be fully mature until it was two years old and ready to live on its own. Not much is known about dragon behaviour, however it seemed that, at least with the Chinese Fireball, females were generally larger and dominant over males."

One notable graduate of Uagadou was Babajide Akingbade, who succeeded Albus Dumbledore as Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards. At an International Symposium of Animagi held in or around 2016, the Uagadou School Team attracted a lot of press when their display of synchronised transformations nearly caused a riot. Many older and more experienced witches and wizards felt threatened by teenagers who could transform at will into elephants and cheetahs, and Adrian Tutley (whose animagus form was a gerbil) lodged a formal complaint with the International Confederation of Wizards.

Rubeus Hagrid remarked to Harry Potter on 31 July 1991 that he disliked cats, as they made him sneeze, implying he was allergic to them. In 1992, Hermione accidentally partly transformed herself into a cat with a botched Polyjuice Potion, having inadvertently added a hair from Bulstrode's cat, believing the hair belonged to its owner. As the potion was not intended for cross-species transformations, this resulted in Hermione spending the rest of her Christmas holidays in the school's Hospital wing to be returned to normal. Cats were also able to interbreed with Kneazles, and generally had up to eight kittens in every litter. There were also Animagi wizards and witches who could assume the form of a cat, notably Minerva McGonagall.

These two competitions breed rivalries between the Houses, the greatest of which is that between Gryffindor and Slytherin. In the early days of Hogwarts, the four founders handpicked students for their Houses. When the founders worried how students would be selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor took his hat off and each \"put some brains\" in it, creating the Sorting Hat to choose future students for each House. At the beginning of each school year, the magical Sorting Hat is placed on each new student's head during the Sorting ceremony. Before beginning the Sorting ceremony, it sings a short song about the founding of the school and the four Houses; the Sorting Hat's songs are different every year, and the Hat is said to take all year composing the next one (according to Ronald Weasley)."

Seeing one of the latches was flicked open (presumably by the Niffler), Scamander ensured the case was set to its 'Muggle-Worthy' setting, which displayed his clothes and goods to the boarding patrol guard rather than the beasts he cared for, in order to keep the guard from discovering the wizarding world. When Scamander stopped in front of the  Steen National Bank to listen to one of Mary Lou Barebone's speeches, the Niffler managed to escape the case and run into the bank, where it attempted to steal valuables from the vaults. Once the Niffler was returned to the case, Kowalski accidentally picked up the wrong case (he too carried an old leather case of similar size). After being set upon the bed, one its latch opened again, causing Kowalski to curiously inspect the case, where a Murtlap was able to jump out onto Kowalski's face.

It is unknown where Runcorn was born, but it is expected that he joined the Ministry of Magic and eventually attained a position of power. After Rufus Scrimgeour was murdered by Voldemort on 1 August, 1997, the Ministry of Magic fell and become controlled by Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. During Pius Thicknesse's administration of the Ministry of Magic, Runcorn informed on Muggle-borns to the Ministry of Magic, subsequently leading to their arrest and imprisonment. It is uncertain whether he was actively in Voldemort's camp, or was simply making use of the upheaval to advance his own aims within the Ministry as Dolores Umbridge was doing. In 1997, Harry Potter impersonated Runcorn (who he learned was apparently quite senior in the Ministry) when he, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley infiltrated the Ministry in order to recover Salazar Slytherin's Locket, one of Voldemort's Horcruxes. Once in the ministry, a wizard who bumped into him in the Atrium apologised and rushed away, and the Minister for Magic, Pius Thicknesse, addressed him familiarly as \"Albert.\" At one point, Harry, as Runcorn, was sharing an elevator with an unnamed wizard who apparently was applauding Runcorn's revelation of the Muggle ancestry of Dirk Cresswell, and trying to grease his way into the position that Dirk had been ousted from."

After being freed Winky fell into a depression from thinking she failed to service Barty Crouch, and began drinking heavily. Winky was dedicated to her master, Barty Crouch Snr and his family, a duty passed down from her mother before her, and grandmother before that. Barty Crouch Senior's son, Barty Crouch Jnr was a convicted Death Eater who had been smuggled out of Azkaban by his father, and replaced by his terminally ill mother, disguised by using the Polyjuice Potion, as her last, dying wish. It was Winky's duty to take care of Barty Crouch Jnr, who had been placed under the Imperius Curse by his father to prevent him from running away, which she did loyally and in secret, for years. During such time, Winky persuaded Barty Snr to reward his son for good behaviour, despite it being a byproduct of the Imperius Curse, and Barty Jnr thought this love was no more than pity. One day, when Bertha Jorkins came to the household with papers for Barty Snr to sign, Winky had her wait for her master to return. Bertha caught Winky speaking with the hidden Barty Jnr, and heard enough to deduce who was underneath the Invisibility cloak. As a reward for his son's good behaviour (with months of persuasion from Winky), Crouch Snr reserved a seat at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup between Ireland and Bulgaria for Winky and himself, and allowed his son to take his seat under the concealment of an Invisibility Cloak; it was made to appear that Winky was simply saving the seemingly empty seat for Crouch Snr, who was too busy with international business to take the seat."

By the 1990s, using any of these three curses on a fellow human being, Muggle or wizard, would result in a life sentence in Azkaban without parole, unless there was sufficient evidence that the caster did so under the influence of the Imperius Curse. Many Dark wizards attempted to use this excuse to prevent themselves from incarceration if caught, particularly after the First Wizarding War. Aurors were permitted to use them during the First Wizarding War, and during the height of the Second Wizarding War under Lord Voldemort's regime, the curses were made legal, though this would have been repealed following Tom Riddle's demise. These three curses had been classified as \"Unforgivable\" in wizarding society since 1717, according to Albus Dumbledore. During the First Wizarding War the Death Eaters made frequent use of these curses and in an effort to even things out, the Ministry of Magic gave Aurors special permission to use them as well. After the First Wizarding War ended with the disappearance of Lord Voldemort, Alice and Frank Longbottom were tortured into insanity with the Cruciatus Curse by four Death Eaters.

Spavin's term was also notable for introducing some reforms to the game of Quidditch (and the commotion they originated): on the night of 21 June, 1884, the Department of Magical Games and Sports decreed the institutionalisation of the Stooging Penalty in Quidditch. This announcement caused widespread discontent among British Quidditch players and fans, who demonstrated profusely at the Ministry of Magic Headquarters: the assembled crowd bombarded a Departmental representative with Quaffles, as well as threatened to stooge Minister Spavin himself.

Despite being the head of their respective wizarding communities, it was common for the Minister to uphold a facade of peace and safety to maintain control and the satisfaction of the public, even if it meant blatantly lying to the citizens, putting them at risk, and forcing the media to corroborate the Ministry's claims. Ministers were democratically elected through a public vote, and there was no fixed limit to a Minister's term in office. When the Ministry of Magic was established in 1707, the man appointed as the first Minister for Magic was Ulick Gamp, formerly Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. After Millicent Bagnold was preparing to retire in 1990, Albus Dumbledore was expected to take the position of Minister, but he believed that due to his past, he could not be trusted with that power, so because of this, Barty Crouch Snr was the next prime candidate, due to his cruel but effective methods of combating the Dark Arts during the First Wizarding War, until he sentenced his son to Azkaban for being a Death Eater. It was after his son's presumed death that the public began to take pity on the boy and thought Crouch Snr was too neglectful as a father, which led to a drop in his popularity, causing him to lose out to Fudge. During the last year of his tenure, Fudge was overcome by self-induced persecution delusions, because Dumbledore 'claimed' Voldemort had returned, and abused his own position to prevent that news from spreading, in order to protect both his position of power and the peace that the Ministry had worked so hard to maintain. In the end, when Fudge was forced to accept that Voldemort had indeed returned, the entire wizarding community called for his resignation, and after a fortnight of futile attempts to remain in office, in July 1996 he was replaced by Rufus Scrimgeour."

Blaise was one of the students who received an invitation from Professor Horace Slughorn for lunch on the Hogwarts Express journey, which might imply that none of Blaise's relatives were Death Eaters, as Slughorn wanted nothing to do with them (it was the reason why he chose not to invite Theodore Nott to join the Club). Slughorn was sizing up the student body for potential new members of his famous Slug Club, which he started when he last taught at Hogwarts. However, he did give a little cough of \"amused scepticism\" when Slughorn told the group that he thought Harry Potter had powers beyond the ordinary. This caused him to provoke Ginny Weasley to snap at him, and Slughorn jokingly warned Blaise not to annoy Ginny, remembering how well she could cast a Bat-Bogey Hex."

Gilderoy Lockhart was born on 26 January, 1964, to a Muggle man and a witch, and had two elder sisters, both of whom were Squibs. Lockhart's mother loved him more than any of his siblings, and this, combined with the revelation of his wizardry and acceptance into Hogwarts, caused his vanity to grow like a tenacious weed. He and his mother forgot, in their excitement, that Hogwarts was a school for all British and Irish wizards, and thus his introduction into the school along with everyone else was, in his eyes, extremely dull. Gilderoy Lockhart entered Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on 1 September, 1975, and was four years below James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew, Lily Evans, and Severus Snape."

It was also capable of reviving a person from any injury, even if the person was at the brink of death, similar to unicorn blood (without the cursed side-effects).

Through the use of Floo powder, witches and wizards were able to enter a fireplace at the origin building and exit a fireplace at the destination building. It could also be used as a means of communication, where magical persons could have their head temporarily transported to another fireplace to speak to those at the destination fireplace. When thrown into a fire burning in a fireplace, Floo powder turned the previously normal flames into harmless, emerald green flames that rose higher than before. One had to toss a handful of powder into a fireplace connected to the Floo Network, walk into the flames, and state the desired destination loudly and clearly to ensure arrival in the proper location. Floo powder can only be used once; so if done incorrectly, one could end up at the wrong location, which Violet Tillyman did in 1855, and Harry Potter did in 1992. While mid-travel, individuals were advised to keep their eyes shut (to keep the soot out of them), keep their elbows tucked in (to avoid banging them on the passing fireplaces) and refrain from fidgeting and/or panicking (to avoid coming out of the wrong fireplace). However, unlike Apparition, one did not require a licence to use Floo powder. It could also be used when one placed only their head into the flames, to partially transport themselves to another location for direct communication."

In protest of the barbaric treatment of the fragile bird, Madam Modesty Rabnott of Kent summoned the Snidget to her, fled the pitch, and released the bird into the wild. Nevertheless, the practise of releasing a Snidget during Quidditch matches continued, with the stakes changed to 150 points, rather than Galleons, awarded to the team of the player who caught the Snidget. Ultimately, use of Snidgets in Quidditch, and the popularity of the sport of Snidget-hunting, depleted the species considerably. About a century after Barberus Bragge's introduction of Snidgets to Quidditch, when it became apparent that the Snidget was close to extinction, Elfrida Clagg, then Chief of the Wizards' Council, declared it a protected species. Clagg also founded the Modesty Rabnott Snidget Reservation in Somerset, England, named in honour of Modesty Rabnott's early efforts at protecting Snidgets. The most notable factor in the protection of the Snidgets was the introduction of the Golden Snitch, invented by metal-charmer Bowman Wright, to the game of Quidditch. During the 1989\u20131990 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, sixth-year students in Care of Magical Creatures class were taught about how to properly handle Golden Snidgets by Professor Silvanus Kettleburn. During the 1990\u20131991 school year, Snidgets were smuggled by at least three witches and wizards from the Somerset sanctuary."

The intended transformation (t) was directly influenced by body weight (a), viciousness (v), wand power (w), concentration (c) and a fifth unknown variable (Z), as described by the following mathematical formula (as taught to first-years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry). Usually, a wizard or witch attempting to perform a Transfiguration spell would often find it easier to transfigure one thing into something else provided that the state it was originally in had something in common to what it would be coverted into (i.e. The overall mass and size of the object or entity to be transfigured into something else must also be considered, since it was stated by Hermione Granger that it was extremely difficult to transfigure something as large as a dragon, even by a skilled transfiguration expert like McGonagall. Furthermore, Transformation was limited by the fact that the dead could not be revived via magic and hence one could not \"transfigure\" the dead back to life, no matter how recently the death occurred."

 "divination": {
  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Divination",
  "summary": "Divination was a branch of magic that involved attempting to foresee the future, or gather insights into past, present and future events, through various rituals and tools. It was described as an inexact science, which required certain mind and concentration techniques to improve one's sensibility and logical thinking, and to gain insight into various events, appearances, details, emotions and thoughts. Therefore, Divination might have been related to Legilimency and possibly some aspects of wandlore. Divination was a more practical way to analyse and interpret a wizard's surroundings by logical thinking and sensibility of mind and body in comparison to Arithmancy, which focused on calculating probabilities, magnitude, strength and effectiveness of magical forces in general including properties of numbers and their application. Witches and wizards who were born with the rare natural gift for prophecy were known as Seers, who cold foresee the future with their Inner Eye. Non-Seers could learn divination methods and develop and gain various insights with them, but their success varied. Hermione Granger once described it as \"woolly\" and \"a lot of guesswork,\" Minerva McGonagall thought it was \"one of the most imprecise branches of magic,\" and before he decided to take on Sybill Trelawney as Divination professor at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore was inclined to scrap the subject altogether. Centaurs had a way of practising divination distinct from that of humans, apparently mainly based around observing the movement of planets, moons, and stars, which they had been doing for centuries by 1996. It could take up to a decade for centaurs to understand what these celestial portents meant, and even then, the results were rarely precise. They may have attempted to narrow their prediction of when an event would take place by burning certain herbs, such as sage and mallowsweet, and looking for various shapes and symbols in the fumes."

A demand Rowling made was that the principal cast be kept strictly British, allowing nevertheless for the inclusion of many Irish actors such as the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, and for casting of French and Eastern European actors in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where characters from the book are specified as such. Rowling was hesitant to sell the rights because she \"didn't want to give them control over the rest of the story\" by selling the rights to the characters, which would have enabled WB to make non-author-written sequels. Although Steven Spielberg initially negotiated to direct the first film, he declined the offer. Spielberg wanted the adaptation to be an animated film, with American actor Haley Joel Osment to provide Harry Potter's voice. Spielberg contended that, in his opinion, there was every expectation of profit in making the film, and that making money would have been like \"shooting ducks in a barrel. In the Rubbish Bin section of her website, Rowling maintains that she has no role in choosing directors for the films, writing \"Anyone who thinks I could (or would) have 'veto-ed' him  needs their Quick-Quotes Quill serviced.\" After Spielberg left, talks began with other directors, including: Chris Columbus, Terry Gilliam, Jonathan Demme, Mike Newell, Alan Parker, Wolfgang Petersen, Rob Reiner, Tim Robbins, Brad Silberling, and Peter Weir."

The magical community, the majority of whom detest and fear giants for their atrocities committed in the past, decided to leave the colony isolated and unsupervised, seeing no reason to attack them as long as they do not cause any trouble for them.

The book contained some controversial, though partially true, revelations about Dumbledore and his family, for example, the story of covering up of the \"sickness\" of Dumbledore's sister Ariana. It also talked about how Dumbledore's father was imprisoned in Azkaban for attacking three Muggles, and explored Dumbledore's relationship in his younger days with Gellert Grindelwald, who would later become an immensely powerful Dark Wizard, second only to Voldemort, and would be defeated in 1945 by Dumbledore himself. In a sneak peek in the Daily Prophet, Rita says that there is a whole chapter on the Dumbledore/Potter relationship. In this article, Rita also comments on the speculation that Harry may have been involved with Dumbledore's murder. Some people, such as Ron's Auntie Muriel, praised Skeeter, while others, such as Elphias Doge and Harry Potter, were furious over Skeeter's conspicuous attempt to impugn Dumbledore's character; Doge went as far as to state that the book \"contain less fact than a Chocolate Frog Card.\" Harry, though angry, did acknowledge the fact of Dumbledore and Grindelwald having once been friends, based on a copy of the letter Dumbledore wrote being printed inside the book. An article concerning The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore was published in the Daily Prophet, which was supplemented by an interview with Rita Skeeter about her views on her book."

  "summary": "Hallowe'en, a contraction of \"All Hallows' Evening\", was a holiday celebrated by both Muggles and the wizarding world on 31 October. Typical festive Hallowe'en activities included trick-or-treating, attending costume parties, decorating, carving pumpkins into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing, visiting haunted attractions, playing pranks, and telling scary stories. The Wizbiz segment of the Sunrise Early Edition published on 6 December the same year from the same paper, reported that the holiday saw record breaking sales of No-Maj broomsticks. At Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, there was a feast every year on Hallowe'en, and the first Hogsmeade weekend of the year usually occurred around the same day. In 1981, the First Wizarding War ended with the disappearance of Lord Voldemort after he murdered James and Lily Potter, and attempted to murder infant Harry Potter. After many of the werewolves were captured during the following full moon, Dumbledore decided to hold the Hallowe'en Feast a second time. In 1985, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's 493rd Deathday Party was co-hosted by Sir Nicholas and Erling in the Deathday Ballroom at Hogwarts. At some point after taking office in 1990, Cornelius Fudge proposed that the Ministry proposed putting restrictions on how wizards and witches were allowed to celebrate Hallowe'en, presumably in consideration to the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy."

Hagrid maintained a pumpkin patch outside his hut, which produced the pumpkins used to decorate the Great Hall for the Hallowe'en Feast. Although the plants are not inherently magical, Hagrid gave them some \"help\" so that the pumpkins swell to the size of garden sheds by the time the feast rolls around. Preceding the Hallowe'en Feast in 1988, some students volunteered to help Albus Dumbledore prepare decorations for the feast, which included carving pumpkins. Five students who carved pumpkins were Jacob's sibling, Rowan Khanna, Penny Haywood, William Weasley and Wilfred Levi Kidd. In Harry Potter's second year, these pumpkins were carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in and displayed during the Hogwarts Hallowe'en festivities. Later in school year, Harry, Hermione and Ron hid behind some pumpkins in order to not be seen by Professor Dumbledore, Cornelius Fudge and the Executioner."

In secret, Malfoy kept the diary before he slipped it, unnoticed, into Ginny Weasley's cauldron of school supplies at Flourish and Blotts in 1992. The diary used its dark magical influence to bewitch and force Ginny to re-open the Chamber of Secrets, but it was destroyed by Harry Potter in 1993 with a Basilisk's Fang. This diary was originally purchased by Riddle in a Muggle shop called Winstanley's Bookstore & Stationers on Vauxhall Road in London, sometime before or during 1943. When Tom Marvolo Riddle was in his fifth year at Hogwarts, he achieved his goal of locating Salazar Slytherin's Chamber of Secrets and used his ability to speak Parseltongue to open it. Knowing it was no longer safe to open the Chamber, and that the school might be shut down if the perpetrator was not caught, Riddle framed Rubeus Hagrid and his pet Acromantula Aragog for the crimes, and earned himself an award for Special Services to the school. In the following years, Riddle also questioned Potions Master, Horace Slughorn about the properties of a Horcrux and how one might create multiple ones."

Albus Dumbledore held the position of Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot in the 20th century, except during the period of July 1995 to June 1996, in which he was removed from the post because of his insistence that Lord Voldemort had returned. He was reinstated when the Ministry was forced to acknowledge Voldemort's return, specifically when he appeared in person at the Ministry of Magic in 1996. In the same period, two of the Wizengamot's oldest members, Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden, resigned from the court in protest after Cornelius Fudge created the position of Hogwarts High Inquisitor to usurp control of Hogwarts from Dumbledore, and were subsequently discredited alongside him; it is unknown if they were reinstated afterwards.

Although the \"department store\" building housing the hospital might have been relatively small, this was not an indication of the true capacity of a magical building. Seventh year students at Hogwarts were taught about the founding of St Mungo's Hospital in History of Magic by Professor Cuthbert Binns during the 1990\u20131991 school year. To enter the premises, one might step through the window of what appeared to be a red-bricked, condemned department store called Purge and Dowse, Ltd. This acted as a magical gateway to the main building, much like the barrier at King's Cross Station to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.

The necklace had fallen to the ownership of at least nineteen Muggles, all of whom died from the deadly curse placed onto it. It seemed this necklace's history was well known, as Minerva McGonagall was horrified the moment she saw it brought in. During the 1989\u20131990 school year, Merula Snyde saw it in the shop and suggested that the necklace would be a good way to kill Patricia Rakepick. In 1992 when Harry Potter mistakenly went to Borgin and Burkes instead of Diagon Alley, he saw the necklace and its warning label. He would remember this four years later, when he encountered the necklace being weaponised by Draco Malfoy. In 1996, four years later, the necklace was purchased at Borgin and Burkes by Draco Malfoy, under the orders of Lord Voldemort.

Bode was described as being \"a sallow-skinned wizard with a very mournful face\", and due to his strange nature spoke in a \"sepulchral\" type of voice and had an unfaltering gaze that made anyone he looked at uncomfortable. That same year, Bode became a target of the Death Eaters, as Lord Voldemort was seeking a prophecy pertaining to himself and Harry, a record of which was stored in the Hall of Prophecies in the Department of Mysteries. Death Eater Avery informed the Dark Lord that an Unspeakable would be able to fetch the prophecy for him, after an attempt to force Sturgis Podmore to steal it while under the Imperius Curse failed. Lucius Malfoy, one of Voldemort's spies at the Ministry, placed Bode under the Imperius Curse to force him to attempt the same theft. Lucius Malfoy noted that Bode showed unusual resistance to the Imperius curse, which Augustus Rookwood suggested may have been because Bode, being an Unspeakable, knew what would happen if he tried to remove one of the Prophecies. Believing Bode had simply been injured in a workplace accident, he was taken to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries for treatment, but his injuries seemed irreparable, and as such was moved to the Spell Damage ward, left lying in his hospital bed, comatose most of the time, and those times he was awake, he was mumbling and staring at the ceiling. Upon learning of this, the Death Eaters, unable to risk the no-longer-Imperiused Bode getting better and exposing their plan, sent him an anonymous \"Christmas present\" \u2014 a potted plant and a calendar."

Rowling's Wizarding World \u2014 including information on all the Harry Potter novels, films, and video games, and all the expanded universe, including, but not limited to,  Pottermore, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, and the Fantastic Beasts series. Unlike what happens in some other fandoms with multiple \"official\" works or original media, most notably Star Trek and Star Wars, what constitutes canon within the Harry Potter franchise has never been officially defined. Though it is widely accepted in the Harry Potter fandom that the seven original novels take canonical precedence, the opinions of fans on the canonicity of other \"official\" materials (such as Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, the Fantastic Beasts series, or even the author's Twitter revelations) differ, at times significantly. The Harry Potter Wiki, starting in 2007 when it defined the wiki's canon policy, has employed a novel approach to canon by assigning different levels of canonicity to different media. This \"canon tier\" system regards the novels and sources that come from J. K. Rowling herself as the highest forms of canon; information from the films is regarded as canon only provided it does not conflict with the books (video games and other officially licenced material is placed on a third tier, below the films). This approach contrasts with another prevalent attitude towards canon in the Harry Potter fandom, which is the Harry Potter Lexicon approach: basically put, it has been the Lexicon's policy ever since it was created in 1999 to consider that canon consists only of the things J. K. Rowling has said or written: ergo, any information that comes solely from the films or video games is automatically non-canon and disregarded. The Harry Potter Wiki will, thus, present some facts, histories, and even entire characters that did not appear in the Harry Potter books as canon. Very much like the Wikipedia model, editors in good standing in the community can run for volunteer stewardship: this begins with Administrators (alternatively called sysops), users who have access to additional technical features that allow them to delete pages, prevent articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes, and try to prevent certain persons from editing."

It is possible that he was taught by Godric Gryffindor himself, given the time period Cadogan lived in. According to wizarding belief, at some point in his life, he struck up a friendship with Merlin, which would eventually secure him a prestigious position on the Knights of the Round Table. According to legend, he was married three times, each time the woman in question leaving him, and fathered seventeen known children. Eventually, Sir Cadogan was appointed the task of defeating the Wyvern of Wye, which was terrorising the West Country. Cadogan's first attempt to combat the creature ended with his original horse killed and his wand, sword, and visor destroyed. At the very least wanting to accept a valiant death, he seized a fat pony from a nearby meadow and charged towards the Wyvern, brandishing his broken wand. Though he was eaten, the broken wand pierced through the Wyvern's tongue and caused the fumes from its stomach to ignite, causing the beast to explode."

The notes on various wand woods should be regarded very much as a starting point, for wand-making was the study of a lifetime, and wandmakers could continue to learn with every wand they made and matched. J. K. Rowling has explained her choice of wand woods for Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort:\nRowling has also revealed that she discovered that Harry's wand wood corresponded to his date of birth in the Celtic tree calendar afterward, and decided to use the calendar to assign the wand woods of Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger as a \"hidden connection\" between the three."

  "summary": "Professor Phineas Nigellus Black (1847 \u2013 1925) was a pure-blood wizard, possibly the son of Cygnus and Ella Black, and brother of Sirius, Elladora and Iola Black. He attended Hogwarts as a member of Slytherin House, later becoming the school's least popular Headmaster, loathing his profession. Phineas Nigellus was born to the House of Black in 1847, possibly to Cygnus Black I and Ella Max. His brother Sirius died in 1853, at the age of eight, which likely had an effect on young Phineas Nigellus. At the age of eleven, circa 1858, Phineas Nigellus began his schooling at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he was sorted into Slytherin House. Sometime after completing his schooling in c. 1865, Phineas Nigellus married Ursula Flint, and, at the age of 30, the two had a son, Sirius Black, named after his deceased brother. Four more children followed the first; Phineas, who did not take his father and namesake's view on the topic of pure-blood supremacy and was disowned by the family for supporting Muggle rights; Cygnus, Belvina, and Arcturus. At some point during his adult life, Black returned to Hogwarts as a teacher; a job he would go on to loathe, as he found his students to be self-obsessed and tedious,  Sometime later, he was made Headmaster of Hogwarts. It is unknown what approach Black took towards Muggle-borns in his capacity as Headmaster; however, as he was never known to have barred them from attending the school during his tenure in the post like Durmstrang Institute did, he was presumably prevented from doing so by the Hogwarts Board of Governors. At the time of his death, Phineas Nigellus had five children, at least thirteen grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren, although more would be born after he died."

Sir Cadogan's portrait was forever challenging people to a fight, falling off its horse and behaving in a fairly unbalanced way, which was how the subject appeared to the poor wizard who had to paint him, while the portrait of the Fat Lady continued to indulge her love of good food, drink, and tip-top security long after her living model passed away. A portrait knew little if anything of its subject's life, and therefore could not hold a very interesting conversation about its subject, as they were only representations of the living subjects as seen by the artist. The exception to this was of the portraits of Hogwarts Headmasters, which were kept in a cupboard from the time of their painting, which was usually very old, until the subject died."

During the 1988\u20131989 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Filius Flitwick taught his fifth-years how to cast this particular charm in Charms class. This spell was later used that school year by Patricia Rakepick, to slow down the falling debris in the Portrait Vault after the resident Hungarian Horntail dragon had awoken. In 1993, Albus Dumbledore used this charm wandlessly to slow down a falling Harry Potter after he was attacked by Dementors during a Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff Quidditch match.

Many thought The Quibbler was rubbish, including Hermione Granger, Rita Skeeter, Jacob's sibling and Dirk Cresswell; the latter referred to it as a \"lunatic rag,\" and when Hermione informed Rita that she would be publishing the interview in The Quibbler, Rita looked at Hermione with disdain. In July or August 1995, the magazine published an edition with an article that put forward the theory that Sirius Black was actually the reclusive rock star Stubby Boardman. The same issue also had a segment written in Runes which caused the reader to look at the magazine upside down, which was probably why Luna Lovegood read it upside down.

  "summary": "In the runic alphabet, the three heads of the Runespoor were used to represent the number three. According to writings from Parselmouths, each of the Runespoor's heads served a different function. The middle head was the dreamer (it is common for a Runespoor to remain stationary for days lost in glorious visions and imaginations), and the right head was the critic; it evaluated the efforts of the left and middle heads with a continuous irritable hissing, and its fangs were highly venomous. It was common to see Runespoors with the right head missing, as the other two heads often banded together to bite it off when it criticised them too much. Some witches and wizards had attempted to create homemade Floo Powder (known as \"Faux Floo\") using the fangs of Runespoors, but like all imitation Floo Powder, it did not suffice, and causes injury, as noted by Rutherford Poke in 2010. The Runespoor had long been associated with Dark Wizards, and what was known of their habits was due in large part to the writings of Parselmouths that have conversed with the creatures. Newt Scamander carried two Runespoors in his suitcase in December 1926: an apparently normal-sized individual whose right head was wearing a protective cone, and an unusually gigantic specimen. Newt later told Tina Goldstein in 1927 that she had \u201cgone middle head\u201d during her investigation on Credence Barebone, explaining it was an expression derived from the three heads of the Runespoor, the middle of which he claimed was the visionary; he also admitted he was most likely the only person who used the expression."

Potions ranged in effects, nature, and brewing difficulty. Potions could be used as: medicines, antidotes, solutions, poisons, or give the drinker any magical effect from strength enhancement to immunity to flames. Potions were not necessarily used by drinking them, as some could be applied by physical contact or create an effect simply by being created, such as the Regeneration potion. According to former Hogwarts Potions Master, Professor Severus Snape, potions could be used for numerous different magical purposes. Potions had a distinct advantage over typical spells in that they could be used even by the non-magical, provided that they had the potion itself at their disposal. Some potions duplicated the effects of spells and charms, but a few (for instance, the Polyjuice Potion, and Felix Felicis) had effects impossible to achieve any other way. Potions were not for the impatient, but their effects were usually difficult to undo by any but another skilled potioneer."

Spells cast using an incorrect incantation might fail in various ways, such as setting things on fire, an undesired outcome, or absolutely nothing at all. In certain cases, the side effects could be quite severe, and Professor Filius Flitwick urged his first year Charms students to remember the example of Wizard Baruffio who once said 's' instead of 'f' and conjured a buffalo on top of his chest. For example, Bartemius Crouch Jnr, in disguise as Alastor Moody stated regarding the Killing Curse (incantation - Avada Kedavra) to his fourth year students that they could \"get your wands out and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed.\" Similarly, a Muggle or Squib would never be able to perform magic, no matter how many incantations they might shout. When introducing his class to his first year students in 1991, Severus Snape stated that there would be \"no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations\" in the class. This however, was likely something of an exaggeration, as it was necessary to channel magic at some point in order to make a potion, and in the case of more complicated potions, the use of a spell might be needed for the identification of ingredients, among other reasons."

Notably, the Polyjuice Potion was used many times in the events leading up to, and during, the Second Wizarding War (and possibly the First Wizarding War, although there were no documented instances of it). The potion also played a crucial role for Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley in their second and fourth years. It was also used in Draco Malfoy's plot to smuggle Death Eaters into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1997, in the Battle of the Seven Potters, and in Harry, Ron and Hermione's Infiltration of the Ministry of Magic and their break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank in 1998. Independent of its actual brewing process, the Polyjuice Potion required a good deal of preparation prior to making it. For example, the lacewing flies must be stewed for twenty-one days prior to making the potion, and only fluxweed picked during a full moon is acceptable. A piece of the person who was to be imitated \u2014 usually hair, but toenail clippings, dandruff, or worse could be used \u2014 was needed for the transformation; apparently, the person must be alive when the piece was taken, as Barty Crouch Jnr kept Alastor Moody alive to continue harvesting his hair.

The way one must imbibe it was very unique among potions, in that a goblet full of wolfsbane potion must have been taken each day for a week preceding the full moon. The ingredients were also very expensive, which made it difficult for some werewolves to brew it themselves, as they usually lived in poverty due to their difficulty in finding stable careers. According to Remus Lupin and Chiara Lobosca, it had a \"disgusting\" taste that was very difficult to get used to, and adding sugar to remedy this was not possible as that substance would render it ineffective. The drinker had to take a gobletful of the potion once a day for a week prior to the upcoming full moon, and missing even one dosage would render it ineffective. The potion did not cure lycanthropy, but rather eased the symptoms, allowing one to hold on to their mental faculties after transformation (which would otherwise not be possible), rendering the dangerous beast into an ordinary, sleepy wolf. When this discovery was made, Remus Lupin thought it was a faint ray of hope, but his hopes were dashed when he found the potion formula's complexity (as Potions was not his strongest suit) and the ingredient list being very expensive."

  "summary": "Hermione Granger warned Fred and George that the Age Line wouldn't be fooled by an Ageing Potion because Dumbledore himself made the age line and she believed that he would have thought of an Ageing Potion in advance. However, Fred, George, and Lee thought that an Ageing Potion would be enough to fool the Age Line magic, but they were wrong; Fred and George were ejected forcefully back over the line and both sprouted long white beards for their trouble. S. Fawcett and Summers also tried to use the potion to age themselves to be eligible for the Tournament, and both also grew white beards from the Age Line. This indicates that the more of the potion is drunk, the larger the degree of ageing that occurs. It is also clear that other magic can see through the effects of this potion, as Dumbledore's Age Line proved. After this, when the Triwizard Champions were announced, a bottle of ageing potion was seen on the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall. This is possibly the Ageing potion that was used by Fred, George, and Lee."

After graduating from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Damocles Belby went on to become a Potioneer and invented the Wolfsbane Potion sometime after the mid-1970s. This potion, made up mostly of Aconite, was able to relieve (but not cure) the effects of Lycanthropy by allowing the werewolf to retain his or her human intelligence while transformed. The potion's development led to werewolves gaining a better chance to integrate themselves into wizarding society, which presumably resulted in his Order of Merlin award. Horace Slughorn claimed that Damocles Belby was an \"outstanding wizard\" and that he well deserved his Order of Merlin award, meaning he was likely highly proficient in many branches of magic.

The Basilisk had a classification as an XXXXX creature, meaning it was a known wizard-killer that couldn't be domesticated due to its immense powers. However, since the Basilisk was still a serpent, a Parselmouth might communicate with it and potentially place the creature under their influence. Tom Riddle was the only one who could command Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk, while Harry Potter had no control over her. The Basilisk could grow up to fifty feet in length, and was a dark green colour with large yellow eyes. Basilisk skin was armoured like that of a dragon's, which deflected spells cast upon it.

In 1992, Firenze saved Harry Potter in the forest from Quirinus Quirrell, who was possessed by Lord Voldemort, frightening Quirrell away and carrying Harry on his back to safety. About four years later, in March 1996, Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, hired him to teach Divination in Sybill Trelawney's stead, after she was sacked by Dolores Umbridge. However, since Firenze was still estranged with his colony, Dumbledore allowed them both to continue teaching, though Trelawney was uncomfortable with sharing her classes with a centaur. When Firenze was injured fighting in the Battle of Hogwarts, he returned to his colony later when the other centaurs had come to the opinion that his pro-human leanings were not so shameful. Firenze was, presumably, born to the centaur colony in the Forbidden Forest, and lived part of his life there. In 1989, Firenze was chosen as the centaur who decided whether Jacob's sibling was allowed to visit the Centaur Camp based on the three gifts offered by them.

Although the potion typically does not kill the victim, as Dumbledore deduced, it nonetheless makes them very weak and vulnerable. As such, for a more complete security, something else should be there to be prepared to attack the victim once they finish drinking the potion. Lord Voldemort used this potion as part of the defences to protect one of his Horcruxes, Salazar Slytherin's Locket, within The Cave. As one person would not be able to drink the entire contents without collapsing from the terrible effects, a second person would be required to force-feed the potion, which Voldemort considered impossible due to the enchanted boat leading to the cave being designed to carry only one adult Wizard. This particular defence was able to be breached on a small number of circumstances through using underage wizards or magical creatures such as house elves, presumably because Voldemort underestimated them. After he had turned Slytherin's locket into a Horcrux, Lord Voldemort decided to use an isolated cave as a secure hiding place. A stone basin existed in the middle of the subterranean lake, and the locket was placed inside at which point it was then immersed in the potion. In order to test the effectiveness of the defences placed around the locket, Voldemort asked his Death Eaters to let him use a house elf. One of them, Regulus Black, volunteered, and ordered his house-elf, Kreacher, to obey Voldemort's instructions and when finished to come back to 12 Grimmauld Place."

 "immortality": {

The Philosopher's Stone, a stone created by famous alchemist Nicolas Flamel, was able to produce the Elixir of Life, one of the known means of immortality. With the destruction of the Philosopher's Stone, all individuals who were immortal because they drank the Elixir of Life (like Flamel and his wife) died after the supply of Elixir ran out. The Elixir did not truly grant immortality, as it only extended the drinker's lifespan, as opposed to rendering them invulnerable to damage. Furthermore, the potion did not rejuvenate youth, as if one lived past their natural lifespan, they would continue to age, eventually taking on a decrepit and ancient appearance, as Nicolas did. A Horcrux was an object chosen for the purpose of being a receptacle of part of one's soul, split by doing the most inhumane action: murder. If at least one of the Horcruxes (and by extension the wizard's soul) were intact, the wizard was considered immortal. Splitting one's soul was considered a violation of the very laws of nature, and existence in such a form was preferred by very few, and was therefore considered the vilest of the Dark Arts."

Its prey of choice was humans, which Magizoologists speculated was the result of the cruelty shown by Phineas Fletcher to the creatures in his power. The Hidebehind was accidentally created when illegal trader Phineas Fletcher attempted to import a trafficked Demiguise into America, with the goal of manufacturing Invisibility cloaks. The Demiguise escaped while on board the ship and bred with a stowaway ghoul, and the offspring escaped into the forests of Massachusetts. In the early 1620s, a Hidebehind of unusual size and strength was chased away by Isolt Sayre after it had managed to capture a young Pukwudgie. The same Hidebehind was later responsible for the deaths of the parents of Chadwick and Webster Boot, but was later defeated by Isolt Sayre and William the Pukwudgie."

The Yeti feared fire, allowing for skilled wizards and witches to repel it. However, the Yeti would attack and eat anything that it met, so no known witch or wizard had the opportunity to study it up close. One time around Christmas, a Yeti was spotted near the grounds at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the 1986\u20131987 school year. In 1992, Gilderoy Lockhart taught his second year Defence Against the Dark Arts class about the Yeti, using his book Year with the Yeti. In 1998, The Quibbler questioned whether four Yeti footprints were sighted or if it was another prank."

However, Isolt enjoyed his company and a unique friendship developed between them. As he would not reveal his true name, per the tradition of his people, Isolt gave him the nickname William, in honour of her late father. During their time together, William introduced her to many creatures native to the area, such as the Hodag, Snallygaster and Wampus cat. One day, William was shocked to find that Isolt had befriended the Horned Serpent at the creek, and was even more wary to discover that the Horned Serpent liked Isolt who was able to understand it. While foraging in the woods, a sound made William tell Isolt to stay hidden while he found out what had happened."

The fire crab was a protected species, and a reservation had been created to protect them from muggles who would value the jewelled shell, as well as wizards who use the shells as cauldrons. Fire crabs were sold and exported as pets in places such as the Magical Menagerie, but the owners required a special licence. The Ministry of Magic stated that a competent wizard should be able to cope with this animal, however they still officially advised wizards not to approach a fire crab from behind or to leave it unattended near flammable material. Fifth years, for their Care of Magical Creatures O.W.L., had to demonstrate how to feed and clean a Fire Crab without sustaining serious burns. Rubeus Hagrid was able to get fire crabs and manticores to mate, creating the hybrid Blast-Ended Skrewts.

In 1992, Ronald Weasley's hand became swollen after it came into contact from venom from Norbert's fangs, resulting in him having to go to the Hospital Wing. Hermione Granger claimed that the contents of Moste Potente Potions would help her to understand what Lockhart had to say about this subject, though this was merely a ploy to obtain the book in order to find the instructions for brewing Polyjuice Potion. On Valentine's Day in 1993, Lockhart suggested that students ask Severus Snape to show them how to whip up a Love Potion, but Snape looked \"as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison\".

At some point before late-1620, Phineas Fletcher smuggled a Demiguise to North America which escaped and bred with a Ghoul; their offspring were the first Hidebehinds. Magizoologist Newton Scamander owned a Demiguise called Dougal, who escaped from his suitcase during his visit to New York in 1926 and caused a disturbance in the Ginzberg Delaunay department store while caring for an Occamy that had also escaped.

  "summary": "The Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, or sometimes known as the Department of Magical Creature Regulation, was the second largest department in the British Ministry of Magic. It was divided into three divisions named after the three categorisations of magical creatures: Being, Beast and Spirit. After leaving Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Hermione Granger briefly worked in this department before transferring to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. In 1750, Clause 73 was inserted in the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy, which stated: Each wizarding governing body will be responsible for the concealment, care, and control of all magical beasts, beings, and spirits dwelling within its territory's borders. Should any such creature cause harm to, or draw the notice of, the Muggle community, that nation's wizarding governing body will be subject to discipline by the International Confederation of Wizards. Because of this, the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures worked very hard to hide the magical creatures living in Britain. The department also strictly controlled the breeding and sale of magical creatures and required that wizards used Disillusionment Charms to conceal creatures that they owned. When a magical creature was seen by Muggles, various methods were used to cover up the incident, including: memory charms cast by Obliviators, spells cast by the Invisibility Task-force, and alibis and non-magical explanations concocted by the Office of Misinformation. Werewolves were shunted between the Beast and Being Divisions of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures for years, because nobody could make up their minds whether werewolves should be classified as Being or Beast."

The three Chasers carried and passed the Quaffle to their opponent's goal hoops, where they tried to score points by throwing it through one of the three rings. Quaffles had to be thrown into the goal hoops in order to score, failing to do so (like carrying through the goal hoop) commits a Haversacking foul. Also, the Keeper must defend the goal hoops from the front of the ring and not the back (a Flacking foul). According to the entries in Gertie Keddle's diary, the Quaffle was the first ball used in the early form of Quidditch played at Queerditch Marsh. Originally, the ball was not enchanted, and made of patched leather with a strap attached to it to allow players to throw and catch it one handed. Some Quaffles had finger holes instead of the strap, rather like a\u00a0Muggle\u00a0bowling ball, or a coconut. In 1711, the Quaffle was changed to its current scarlet colour, after a match played in heavy rain made it indistinguishable from the muddy ground.

The sword was later used in Albus Dumbledore's and Harry Potter's hunt for Horcruxes, as a tool of destruction against the Horcruxes, as means to make Lord Voldemort mortal again. The sword of Gryffindor was made in the 10th century by goblins, the magical world's most skilled metalworkers, and is therefore enchanted. The sword was made to Godric Gryffindor's specifications by Ragnuk the First, finest of the goblin silversmiths, and therefore King (in goblin culture, the ruler does not work less than the others, but more skillfully). Instead he sent them back to their king bewitched, to deliver the threat that if he ever tried to steal from Gryffindor again, Gryffindor would unsheathe the sword against them all. In May of 1993, the sword materialised inside the old school Sorting Hat and appeared to Harry Potter, to whom the hat was given when he arrived in the Chamber of Secrets to save his best friend's sister, Ginny Weasley, from being drained of her life force by Tom Riddle's Diary and eaten by the Basilisk. This caused the sword to be imbued with basilisk venom (since goblin-made items only absorb what makes them stronger) and hence gained the ability to destroy Horcruxes, although Harry instead used one of the Basilisk's fangs to destroy the diary, which eliminated the sentient memory of Tom Riddle it contained and restored Ginny's vitality."

That is to say, if the human died, the soul would be able to move on beyond the Veil or return as a ghost. A Fidelius Charm implanted a secret into a person's very soul, which would give the secret the highest level of security, unless the Secret-Keeper chose to divulge it. If a Horcrux was destroyed, the soul within would die away and disappear. This seemed different for the \"main\" portion of the soul that remained within the body, as it served as the sense of awareness and psyche for the person, meaning that only one portion could maintain such full attributes despite multiple pieces, and this piece could retain existence without any container. Any portion of a soul encased into a Horcrux could gain a sense of sentience, by sapping away the life-force of any unfortunate person to come in possession of such an item, and in turn that portion of soul could gain a solid human form for itself."

Fiendfyre was an immensely powerful fire that couldn't be extinguished by normal or enchanted water, It was also very difficult for the caster to control, flowing from their wand in a continuous stream of flame. If the caster flicked their wand when the stream of flame was still running from it, a jet of fire would shoot off and become a flaming animal. When cast, the fire appeared with a roaring, billowing noise and gave its victims only a split-second's warning to escape, quickly consuming anything in the vicinity of its caster. The flames were of an abnormally large size and take the shape of fiery monsters and beasts such as snakes, dragons, eagles, and chimaeras, constantly mutating into other beasts as well as powerful, formless flames that destroy all things around itself. The fire even possessed a sentience of its own, a continuous (though far from latent) desire to burn anything it could. It would pursue any nearby lifeforms and anything that it could destroy, and was capable of incinerating anything through mere contact. As Fiendfyre was inherently extremely dangerous, most casters would have major difficulty with controlling the fire once it had been unleashed. Hermione Granger was aware of this, but never considered the use of it against Voldemort's Horcruxes due to the inherently dangerous, uncontrollable nature of the spell."

In 1994, Harry noted that he would have gladly split half the contents of his vault to the Weasleys, but he knows full well they would never accept it. Being a bank employee, Bill Weasley was able to circumvent this and obtained gold from this vault in order for Harry to buy school supplies."

  "summary": "This article focuses on the PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube versions of Electronic Arts's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets video game. They are all very similar to each other, with the PlayStation 2 version differing the most out of all three of them, featuring additional exploration and gameplay, and subtle differences in graphics. While the book that the film was based on has had a far-reaching appeal that's crossed age barriers, the games were definitely skewed toward younger players. Fortunately, the follow-up, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets for the PlayStation 2, manages to come far closer to capturing the franchise's appeal. Offering a polished mix of strong graphics and solid gameplay, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a marked improvement over its predecessor. While the game does take some dramatic licence, fans of the movie and book will be pleased to be able to participate in many of the key action sequences integral to the story. In addition to the main set of objectives you'll have to complete to progress through the game, you'll also find a meaty selection of minigames you can play, such as Quidditch, assorted gnome-centric diversions, broomstick races, and side quests to track down collectible Wizard Cards."

  "summary": "Aragog had a wife, Mosag, and was the leader of a large Acromantula colony composed of all of his sons and daughters. During his life, Aragog was accused of being Slytherin's Monster, although this was really a basilisk. After Aragog died, some of his venom was taken by Horace Slughorn and was most likely sold later on. Somehow, the egg came into possession of Rubeus Hagrid, who at the time was a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After Aragog hatched from it, Hagrid kept him in a cupboard in one of the school's dungeons, feeding him scraps. In 1943, Tom Marvolo Riddle, a descendant of Salazar Slytherin who would later become Lord Voldemort, opened the Chamber of Secrets and unleashed the resident monster, Basilisk, upon the castle to exterminate its Muggle-born population, those who were \"unworthy\" to study magic. But when one of its victims, Moaning Myrtle, died in a bathroom, it motivated the school's governors to consider closing the school. Tom, who considered Hogwarts his only home, found out about Aragog after discovering the young Hagrid tending to the Acromantula, and used Aragog as a scapegoat for the monster's rampage."

It is possible she purchased it from the Ollivander family, who had been in the wand-making business since 382 B.C., or made it herself. United by the common goal of creating the world's best magic school, Rowena Ravenclaw and her good friends Helga Hufflepuff, Godric Gryffindor, and Salazar Slytherin built Hogwarts Castle together and established Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry sometime around 993. It is a popular historical theory that the location and name of Hogwarts were both chosen by Rowena, who dreamt that a warty hog was leading her to a cliff by the lake.

Christianity is currently the most popular religion of Great Britain with approximately 60% of its population identifying itself as Christian, most of them Protestant. Wizards celebrate the two major Christian festivals, Easter and Christmas. However, this is not concrete evidence of the religion in the wizarding world because many nonreligious people or people of other religions celebrate these as well, as secular holidays. In addition, Christmas and Hallowe'en are also strongly based in Pagan traditions that the Christian church adapted to their own sensibilities.

His legacy includes the creation of the Being, Beast and Spirit Divisions of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, and the establishment of the Department of Magical Games and Sports. Stump was born in 1770, somewhere in Great Britain to at least one magical parent. He decreed that a being was \"any creature that has sufficient intelligence to understand the laws of the magical community and to bear part of the responsibility in shaping those laws\", and by doing so, he settled a debate that had been going on in the wizarding world since the fourteenth century. Stump created the three divisions of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures: Being, Beast, as well as later Spirit Divisions. It is likely that during Stump's tenure in office there were ghost demonstrations at the Ministry of Magic (or \"protest floats\"), which caused Stump to create the aforementioned Spirit Division. A passionate Quidditch fan, supporting the Tutshill Tornados, Minister Stump also was responsible for establishing the Department of Magical Games and Sports."

When one of her predecessors, Ottaline Gambol, authorised an operation to acquire the Hogwarts Express, the Ministry had seen fit to build a railway station at Hogsmeade. The Ministry was not so keen, however, on building another station, in plain sight, in Muggle London, as it would be in all likelihood a serious breach of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy. King's Cross Station was opened in 1852, during Orpington's time in office. Minister Orpington was also good friends with Queen Victoria, who never realised that she was a witch or Minister for Magic. Minister Orpington left the office in 1855, to be regarded as one of the most accomplished Ministers in British history."

After a time in which the school enjoyed great prosperity, Helga's fellow founder Salazar Slytherin proposed a controversial action in which Muggle-born students should not be admitted to Hogwarts based on their heritage. Hufflepuff and the rest of the founders refused this, however, and the problem escalated to such degrees that Salazar ultimately left the school permanently. One relic of Hufflepuff's, a small golden cup, had been passed down to her distant descendant Hepzibah Smith."

When he taught Care of Magical Creatures, Silvanus Kettleburn normally covered them in third year classes. However, as in the 1986\u20131987 school year, Severus Snape needed them for Potions, students who started learning the subject in 1986 did not get them covered in the class until their fifth year. After losing his nerve during the Hippogriff debacle in his first Care of Magical Creatures lesson during the 1993\u20131994 school year, Rubeus Hagrid had his third year students raise Flobberworms for a term. Later on in the school year, the flobberworms died from overeating lettuce.

However, when he found that all the houses in the neighbourhood were protected by a new Anti-Alohomora Charm invented by Blagdon Blay, he was so infuriated upon returning home that he neglected to Stun his Nundu and was swiftly killed by the beast.

However, Rowle scrapped the plans and insisted on using Azkaban instead, which had previously been a Dementor-infested fortress used by the insane dark wizard Ekrizdis in the 15th century and was now abandoned. He claimed that the Dementors populating the island could be harnessed as guards, saving the Ministry time, expense and trouble, and thus being an advantage. Rowle carried out his plan, in spite of protests from experts on both Dementors and buildings with a dark history such as Azkaban. Many prisoners were placed there, and even those who had not been mad and dangerous when they came to Azkaban, swiftly became so. His actions as Minister led to him being censured by the International Confederation of Wizards, and he was therefore forced to step down, turning over the office to Perseus Parkinson. Despite Rowle being forced to step down however, the island still remained infested with Dementors, and the creatures were still used as guards until the outbreak of the Second Wizarding War.

The point of the W.O.M.B.A.T.s was to test the worth of an individual in order to discern whether or not the sitter were able to exist safely and effectively within the magical world. usually took twenty-five minutes to complete, although more advanced levels (such as Grade 3) took more time; thirty-five minutes. The Ministry would then spend \"a few days\" going over and marking each test, whereupon an owl was sent to deliver the results to the people that took the test; as well as provide feedback on how well they did and what their prospects were relative to the achieved test scores.

  "summary": "The United States of America (more commonly known as America, United States, the States, or simply U.S. or U.S.A.) is a large and very diverse country located in North America. It shares land borders with Canada and Mexico, and a maritime border with Cuba along the Florida Strait, and Russia in the Bering Strait. 48 states are located between Canada and Mexico, while Alaska occupies the northwestern-most region of the continent. Established in part by European Puritans seeking religious freedom, No-Maj settlement began in the 1600s. Their religious beliefs made them suspicious of magic, which led to the Salem Witch Trials, in which both witches and wizards were executed. In 1790, Rappaport's Law created a strict segregation between the magical and No-Maj communities. During the 1920s, many No-Majes in New York were baffled by strange disturbances including a black mass causing destruction as reported in the New-York Clarion newspaper. In the Native American community, some witches and wizards were accepted and even lauded within their tribes, gaining reputations for healing as medicine men, or outstanding hunters. A legend grew up around the Native American Animagi, that they had sacrificed close family members to gain their powers of transformation."

In the 1990\u20131991 school year at Hogwarts, Professor Arif Sikander taught seventh year students in Muggle Studies about the nature of rotary phones. On 31 July of the same year, when Harry Potter watched Rubeus Hagrid using owl post to send a letter to Albus Dumbledore, he noted that Hagrid sat down as though what he had done was as normal as talking on the telephone. On 6 August, 1992, Arthur Weasley spoke to Harry on how to use the telephone, which Arthur found rather ingenious and interesting. On 31 July, 1993, Ronald Weasley attempted to make a telephone call to 4 Privet Drive, Harry having given he and Hermione Granger the telephone number for the house at the end of the previous school year. Hermione also decided not to call, as it might have gotten Harry into trouble again, which was unfortunate for Harry, because he was sure that, as a Muggle-born, Hermione would have known not to shout. That same year, Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban and a telephone hotline was established for Muggles to report sightings of him. One such Muggle reported to the hotline after seeing Black in Dufftown, which was not too far from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but by the time police arrived, he had left. On 16 August, 1994, a man named Frank Bryce, possessing no telephone of his own, resolved to use a telephone booth to contact police after hearing the plans of Lord Voldemort, but was unable due to his subsequent murder."

They were dangerously violent and incredibly aggressive, and they engaged in unpredictable behaviour, comparable to giants. They were also incredibly low in intelligence, of which giants seemed to have more. Trolls were particularly attracted to unpleasant smells, such as Dungbombs. Trolls, similar to Acromantulas, had a taste for human flesh. Troll language was supposedly nothing more than simple grunts that only Trolls seemed to be able to interpret, though skilled magical multi-linguists such as Barty Crouch could understand them.

Some people, both wizards and Squibs, made a living by breeding Kneazles or part-Kneazles, such as Arabella Figg. One notable Kneazle hybrid was Hermione Granger's half-Kneazle, Crookshanks, who she purchased from the Magical Menagerie in Diagon Alley in 1993, which was known to sell Kneazles. Kneazle whiskers could be used in wand cores, although they were said to make inferior wands when compared with unicorn hair, phoenix feather and dragon heartstring. They had a very high level of intelligence, were independent and occasionally aggressive, and had an uncanny ability to detect suspicious and distrustful people. Because of their aggression towards certain individuals, Kneazles had an XXX classification by the Ministry of Magic, if they were not interbred with another species. In 1832, wizard Abel Treetops of Cincinnati claimed to have patented a method of taming Wampus cats for use as guards over wizarding houses.

Their feet were hard and bony, and they did not look anything like the garden gnomes of Muggles (which, according to Ronald Weasley, looked like little Father Christmases with fishing rods). Gnomes lived in burrows underground, known as gnomeholes, where they dug up and ate the roots of plants, creating little heaps of earth around gardens a lot like moles (and as such causing considerable damage to them). Gnomes preferred to live in wizarding gardens, and may have ran out and attempt to trip the unwary traveller. Crookshanks was fond of chasing gnomes around the garden of The Burrow, and the gnomes seemed just as fond of being chased.

It was also able to open doors locked by the Locking Spell (Colloportus), and as such, acted as its counter-charm. The Unlocking Charm had its origins in Africa, whereupon it was called the Thief's Friend. The first known person to have mastered the charm was an Ancient African sorcerer, who taught it to thief Eldon Elsrickle during the latter's trip to the continent in the 17th century. Upon returning to his native Britain, Elsrickle used it to terrorise London, stealing from homes of Muggles and wizards alike, until Blagdon Blay invented the Anti-Alohomora Charm. Before he died, Elsrickle gave knowledge of the Unlocking Charm in exchange for his freedom on the infrequent occasions he broke into a magical household, resulting in the spell being widespread in the country. Before the discovery of Alohomora, the most popular unlocking spell was Portaberto, which splintered the lock from a door but occasionally left a smoking hole where the key should have gone. Before Portaberto, however, the most popular opening spell was Open Sesame, which ripped doors from their hinges and tore them into firewood. In the summer of 1992, Harry Potter considered using this charm to unlock the cage of his pet owl Hedwig at 4 Privet Drive, but did not, since he knew that underage wizards and witches were not allowed to use magic outside of Hogwarts."

At the top of the screen and attached to both teams' scores is a Golden Snitch gauge, signalling both the teams' relative momentum and how close the climactic Snitch chase is. Successfully following the Snitch's path regenerates the boost metre faster, and successfully catching the Snitch, as always, awards 150 points and ends the game. Furthermore, the scores are locked in during the Snitch chase, meaning that no goals are scored during the chase\nAs the player progresses in the House Quidditch Cup and completes more drills, he or she also unlocks more features that also charge with momentum banked in the Snitch gauge:\nThe introduction features Harry and Oliver Wood dressed in their Gryffindor Quidditch team uniforms instructing the player on the basic rules and objectives of Quidditch."

During the night Harry, Ron and Hermione went to penetrate the Underground Chambers, the trio left the common room but was confronted by Neville and a croaking Trevor until Hermione froze Neville using the Full Body-Bind Curse. In Neville's third year, Trevor was part of the Frog Choir when they performed Double Trouble on 1 September. After Trevor drank the potion, he successfully transformed into a tadpole, much to Neville's delight. When Harry encountered Neville in the last carriage of the Hogwarts Express in their fifth year, Neville had a one-handed grip on a struggling Trevor."

Acromantulas were believed to be a wizard-bred species, designed to guard dwellings or treasure hoards, and were first created before the Ban on Experimental Breeding in 1965. Acromantulas sported eight, black eyes (white if blind) and were typically covered in thick black hair, with a leg span that can reach up to fifteen feet. On average, they were the size of a carthorse, though old specimens such as Aragog may grow to 15 feet in leg span. Their fangs contained highly toxic venom, valued at 100 Galleons a pint in 1996. The female was usually larger than the male, and can lay up to one-hundred soft, wide, beach ball-sized eggs at a time. In contrary to most non-magical spiders, Acromantulas were social animals, who lived in large colonies consisting of hundreds of their species. These colonies were led by the oldest male and female of said colonies, who were highly respected and met with absolute obedience."

After the incident, she became a ghost who haunted the second-floor girls' bathroom (and occasionally other bathroom facilities) at Hogwarts. In 1943, sometime into Myrtle's education, the Chamber of Secrets was opened for the first time. It was believed that Gryffindor student, Rubeus Hagrid had opened the Chamber because he was caught raising Aragog (an Acromantula), but it was actually Tom Marvolo Riddle, a Slytherin student. On her final day of her life, 13 June 1943, Myrtle was teased by student Olive Hornby, who made fun of Myrtle's glasses and left Myrtle alone sobbing. Shortly after Myrtle had entered the bathroom, Riddle entered and started speaking in Parseltongue in order to open the Chamber of Secrets, the entrance of which was hidden behind the sink in front of the very stall occupied by Myrtle at the time."

  "summary": "The Lethifold resembled a black cloak roughly half an inch thick, and appeared slightly thicker if the creature had recently digested a victim. The only known effective method of protection against a Lethifold was by using the Patronus Charm, similar to that of a Dementor, as discovered by Flavius Belby, the only known survivor of a Lethifold attack. In 1782, Belby was on holiday in Papua New Guinea, and he managed to repel the attack because he was not fully asleep at the time. After unsuccessful repelling attempts with various spells, Belby managed to conjure a Patronus at the last second, causing the Lethifold to release him and slink away. Previous victims had apparently been unable to do this because they were either asleep, were Muggles, or unable or did not think to cast a Patronus Charm. It was virtually impossible to determine the number of Lethifold victims, as the creatures left no clues to its presence. Much easier to calculate however, was how many people had faked a Lethifold attack, for their own reasons. One known case of an individual attempting to fake a Lethifold attack was Janus Thickey, who disappeared in 1973, leaving behind a note reading \"Oh no, a Lethifold's got me, I'm suffocating\"."

There were several different species of Horned Serpents found world-wide; large specimens were found in the Far East, and the most diverse group still in existence was native to North America. Horned Serpents had a horned head, thus why they are named. Ancient bestiaries suggested Horned Serpents were once native to Western Europe, but were hunted to extinction by wizards in search of potion ingredients. Around 1620, the Irish-born witch\u00a0Isolt Sayre befriended a Horned Serpent near Mount Greylock in present-day Massachusetts. She was able to understand the serpent, and when founding Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry she chose the Horned Serpent as the symbol of one of the school's four houses.

In the 1620s, Isolt Sayre and the Pukwudgie, William took trips together to observe these creatures hunting. During its search for Mooncalves, the Hodag had been attracted to Muggle farms at night, piquing No-Maj interest, much like the Snallygaster.

Merpeople were creatures resembling half-human, half-fish hybrids (though they are not, in actuality, half-breeds). Like humans, Merpeople came in a variety of appearances, For instance, the majority of the Black Lake Merpeople colony had green hair, yellow eyes, and grey skin. Merpeople also seem to be taller than humans, with seven feet appearing to not be an unusual height, at least for a selkie. Harry encountered one in the lake near Hogwarts who was seven feet tall with a long green beard and a choker of shark fangs, carrying a spear. Merpeople were divided up into various sub-species or races, depending on where they live. The earliest merpeople lived in Greece, and were known as sirens. In modern times, merpeople living in warmer waters take on a more beautiful appearance, while those in colder waters, such as the selkies of Scotland and the Merrows of Ireland, are less attractive. Merpeople are a sapient species, and would qualify for full being status if they did not, as a race, reject the classification. Although their exact level of intelligence as compared to humans is unknown, they possess many traits beyond those of mere animals."

After about two months, Skrewts grew to about three feet long and became extremely ill tempered, making it hard to get close to one. They grew grey, shiny armour over their pale bodies and began to resemble a cross between giant scorpions and elongated crabs. The males held their stingers over their backs, and were highly dangerous and repulsive. After several months, Skrewts grew to about ten feet long, and were incredibly dangerous (and probably quite lethal). Their shiny armour deflected most spells, and they used their blasts to propel themselves at a foe."

You begin at Harry's home, visit Diagon Alley in order to procure school supplies, and then travel to Hogwarts School, where most of the action occurs. You'll also visit a number of locations that should be familiar if you've read the novels, such as Mulpepper's Apothecary and Hagrid's hut. Most of the events that occur in the book also occur in the game, including minor milestones such as learning spells or Quidditch matches. They're all much more drawn out, however, in that you'll often have to navigate a dungeon full of switches or gather a dozen different items before completing the assigned task. On the one hand, it's good that you have to explore dungeons filled with puzzles and monsters in order to advance the story. These opportunities let you explore Harry's world, interact with the characters, and play with a half-dozen unique spells."

During the Calamity which occurred in the 2010s, volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force could fight against Erklings in Fortresses throughout the wizarding world, with the activation of certain Runestones within these buildings. The name Erkling may have been influenced by the English word \"irk\", meaning to annoy and \"erlkings\", elfish creatures in German mythology which have a fatal influence on children. Erlking is a translation of the German erlk\u00f6nig which literally means \"alder king\", and may in turn be an 18th-century mistranslation of the original Danish word elverkonge, literally \"elf king\"."

This Chocolate Frog Card would serve as an instrumental source of information to assist Harry Potter in his discovery of Voldemort's plot to steal the Philosopher's Stone. On 1 September, 1991, Harry Potter purchased a large quantity of wizarding sweets from the Honeydukes Express during his first trip on the Hogwarts Express, including some Chocolate Frogs. This would serve as his first introduction to two things: the concept of moving portraits in the wizarding world and the identity of Dumbledore himself, who would soon become his headmaster and a close friend. Later that school year, Harry and his friends Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger searched feverishly for the identity of Nicolas Flamel, who they knew from an unintentional tip from Rubeus Hagrid was connected to the mysterious package that had been transported from Gringotts Wizarding Bank to Hogwarts Castle. As the trio were beginning to give up hope, Harry gave a Chocolate Frog to Neville Longbottom to console him after he had the Leg-Locker Curse cast on him by Draco Malfoy. After looking at it again, Harry realised that Flamel's name was on the card as a partner of Dumbledore's in alchemy. During the British Ministry of Magic's attempt to discredit Dumbledore in 1995, William Weasley noted that Dumbledore joked that he didn't care how many of his titles and accolades he lost as long as his Chocolate Frog Cards continued to be made. Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark Wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel."

  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Miranda_Goshawk",
  "summary": "Miranda Goshawk was born in 1921, somewhere in Great Britain, the last of nine daughters born to the wizarding Goshawk family. Her family was relatively impoverished by the time she arrived, and she recalls having to wear her sisters' hand-me-down robes, which she found \"embarrassing\". In her youth, she received formal instruction, attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from approximately 1932 to 1939. To further her confusion when it came to learning magic, her sisters used to deliberately give her the wrong incantation for every spell she attempted. As the youngest child in a large family, she also often found it difficult to make herself heard, and sometimes resorted to using the Bat-Bogey Hex \u2014 which she invented herself \u2014 to render whoever she wanted to give a piece of her mind silent long enough to let her speak. She used it on her sister Diadema to get her to return clothes she borrowed without permission; on her sister Romilda to keep her out of her room went she wanted to be left alone; and on her sister Tangwystl when she wanted to keep her quiet so she could finish her homework. After her schooling, in which she self-admittedly \"struggled\", Ms. Goshawk realised that the help she had needed as a young witch simply did not exist. In response to this, she made a living by writing school textbooks all the while striving to make her writings both scientifically correct and academically useful, but also appealing and plain enough to be understood without too much difficulty, allowing every student to be in possession of knowledge about \"basic and not-so-basic\" witchcraft. Her first book, the Book of Spells, was a success: it was not only translated into seventy-two languages (among them, Gobbledegook and Mermish), but it also became an approved textbook in many schools for magic around the world."

  "summary": "They do not make nests, instead sheltering inside trees, ground burrows, caves, and barns, or using other birds' old nests. Normally, most British owls are nocturnal, and owls generally keep to themselves, but in the wizarding world they served many needed functions and had many sorts of personalities. Letters, parcels, and Howlers were all delivered by owls. Soft, hair-like edges on an owl's flight feathers reduced the noise of flight, coupled with their natural camouflage, making them ideal for delivering letters. Owls had a natural affinity to magic (unlike pigs, which were thoroughly non-magical), and thus could find the recipient of a letter without an address. Because owls could find any witch or wizard whom a letter was addressed to, those who did not wish to be contacted must cast Repelling, Disguising, or Masking spells, of which a wide variety existed. Owls were used for commercial purposes, such as those used for the Owl Post Office in Hogsmeade, and for delivering newspapers and magazines such as the Daily Prophet and The Quibbler. The Ministry of Magic formerly used owls for interdepartmental memos, but switched to enchanted paper aeroplanes because owls made too much mess with their droppings and shed feathers. Postal owls all had different jobs, but scops owls were enlisted for local deliveries only, as they were small and weak fliers."

At some point in his life, he was elected the President of his local local Gobstones club, a moment that he would always remember to be one of the happiest of his life. In 1782, aged 66 or 67, Belby was on holiday in Papua New Guinea. One night, when he was lying awake on his bed, a Lethifold entered his bedroom, sliding through the little space underneath the door. Belby was awake (which is unusual for a Lethifold attack), and as such, had an opportunity to defend himself. Incapable of breathing, Belby was next to unconsciousness when, using his last ounce of strength, he recalled the memory of the day that he was elected president of his local Gobstones Club, and produced a corporeal Patronus that drove the creature off. Belby would later write about this near-death experience:\nBelby died less than a decade later, in 1791, but the attack and his miraculous survival was remembered for centuries after. For being the only known wizard to survive a Lethifold attack though a combination of not being completely asleep and the use of a Patronus Charm, he appeared on a Chocolate Frog Card."

Dumbledore told Harry that he and another wizard, Gellert Grindelwald took this to mean that the uniter of the Deathly Hallows would be invincible. No one but Harry Potter had been known to have been in command of all three at the same time, though he was never in possession of them all at once (he dropped the stone in the Forbidden Forest just before gaining the wand that he had won the alliance of in a previous scuffle at Malfoy Manor). Albus Dumbledore had also possessed all three, but not all at once, much like Harry, as he was never the true owner of the Cloak. Hundreds of years ago, the three Peverell brothers were travelling at twilight, and reached a river too dangerous to cross.

At some point during the 1986\u20131987 school year, Professor Flitwick announced in the Great Hall that there would be auditions for the Choir, as two members had left. Tulip Karasu felt her toad Dennis to be depressed, and that joining the Choir might cheer him up; since Tulip admitted to be a terrible singer, she asked Jacob's sibling to audition with her toad. The choir members sang while carrying toads (one of which was Trevor, Neville Longbottom's toad) which croaked during the song, and were accompanied by a harpsichord, a drum, a harp and flutes. While Filius Flitwick joined the feast, the choir retreated from the Hall after the song. In 1995, Dolores Umbridge was put in charge of observing teachers and their lessons and inspected one of Flitwick's choir practices in the Great Hall. As she watched, Flitwick turned and smiled at her while conducting, as though waiting for her to praise the Frog Choir, though she just got out a pink measuring tape. In early October 1996, the choir had an emergency practice that forced Professor Flitwick to retreat from Hogsmeade Village back to Hogwarts Castle; it is unknown if there actually was a Choir Practice or if Flitwick was merely using it as an excuse to avoid Slughorn. At the end of the school year, Flitwick had a rehearsal with the choir in the Great Hall late in the evening."

  "summary": "The Owlery was a circular stone room, rather cold and draughty, because none of the windows had glass in them. The floor was entirely covered in straw, owl droppings, and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles (rodents that are fed upon by owls) that rose right up to the top of the tower. In the 1989\u20131990 school year, Jacob's sibling came to the Owlery to look for a white owl, and they searched together with Talbott. Later that school year, Talbott managed to spot a white eagle owl, but it flew away as soon as Talbott entered the Owlery. Talbott told Penny Haywood about this, and she informed Jacob's sibling he wanted to see them in the Owlery. One letter stood out as Talbott suspected it was written in Japanese, which made Jacob's sibling suspect it was to or from a dark wizard attempting to kill them. During the Second Wizarding War, students and staff stopped using the Owlery for sending post to other people inside the Castle, because any letters that were sent using the Owlery were checked by Argus Filch."

  "summary": "The Full Body-Bind Curse (Petrificus Totalus), also known as the Body Freezing Spell, was a curse that temporarily paralysed the opponent. When used on a living subject, the victim's arms and legs snapped together, and they would fall down, stiff as a board. However, the person's abilities to hear, see (albeit just straight forward), feel, and think still worked properly. Technically, the spell also worked on inanimate objects, but its effects were usually imperceptible, because the object was not moving in the first place. The effects of the Full-Body Bind Curse could be undone by use of the General Counter-Spell, the healing spell Episkey, an Anti-Paralysis Potion or the Reparifors spell. Despite the incantation, the Full Body-Bind Curse was fundamentally different from petrification, which was highly advanced Dark Magic and which cannot be reversed by a simple counter-curse. During the 1986\u20131987 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Filius Flitwick taught his third-years how to cast this particular spell in Charms class."

He was posthumously disowned and removed from the Black family tree tapestry by Sirius' mother, Walburga, and Sirius believed that this act of charity towards him was the reason why. Judging from Alphard's action of helping his nephew when he ran away from home, it can be deduced that he was, at the very least, capable of love and fondness. It can therefore be inferred that he might have been kind and compassionate in his life, which made Alphard vastly different from his sister Walburga Black and his younger brother Cygnus Black III for that matter, in that he wasn't bothered about his nephew being a blood traitor. He shared similarities with his niece Andromeda Tonks and his distant relative Cedrella Black, in that they were all the middle child of three, sorted into Slytherin, and disowned.

  "summary": "It took place on 18 June 1996, after the powerful Dark Wizard Lord Voldemort secretly lured his archenemy Harry Potter to the Department of Mysteries inside the British Ministry of Magic in London in an effort to obtain the prophecy concerning his futuristic defeat at Potter's hands, as the young wizard was the one prophesied to end Voldemort and his dark reign for good. Once at the Ministry, Harry was cornered by at least a dozen Death Eaters, but the young hero was aided by five of his fellow members of Dumbledore's Army: Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood; all of whom managed to successfully hold their ground and fend off the Death Eaters until the Order of the Phoenix came to their rescue. In the resulting skirmish, the prophecy was accidentally destroyed, Voldemort was personally seen by Minister Cornelius Fudge himself, all but one of the Death Eaters were captured by Albus Dumbledore, and Sirius Black was killed by his deranged and sadistic cousin Bellatrix Lestrange. In 1980, at the height of the First Wizarding War, which lasted for eleven years (from 1970 to 1981), Sybill Trelawney, the great-great granddaughter of the famous seer and magical hypnotist Cassandra Trelawney, was being interviewed by Albus Dumbledore at the Hog's Head Inn in Hogsmeade for the position of Divination teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. During the interview, Trelwaney suddenly entered into a heavy trance and predicted the future coming of the only person who could truly defeat and destroy Lord Voldemort, due to this particular wizard having strength, power, will, and most of all: a capability for Love, that would not only equal and surpass those of the Dark Lord, but those of Albus Dumbledore himself. This prophecy was in turn heard in its entirety by Dumbledore, but also overheard in part by Severus Snape, at the time a loyal high-ranking Death Eater, who immediately reported what he heard to Voldemort. After some searching, Voldemort came to heavily suspect that the prophecy referred to the offspring of someone within the Order of the Phoenix, the resistance movement founded and led by Albus Dumbledore against Voldemort and the Death Eaters. After researching the members of the Order, Voldemort concluded that there were only two possible candidates: Harry Potter; the only son of James Potter and Lily Potter, and Neville Longbottom, the only son of Frank Longbottom and Alice Longbottom."

Still, she feared that she would miss the release of the fifth Harry Potter book, but the hospital released her for the morning of the book release, and it was arranged for her to receive a copy of the book signed by J.K. Rowling herself. Evanna attended Cartown National School, and later, an all girls' Catholic school, called Our Lady's College, Greenhills, located in Drogheda, Ireland.

The letter was delivered by Percy's pet owl, Hermes, and Ron was at first surprised to receive the letter, considering Percy's de facto defection from the family. The letter was sent during the Ministry's campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter, and Percy's letter proved that he was clearly speaking what the Ministry believed. Having heard from Cornelius Fudge that his brother Ron had been made a Gryffindor prefect, Percy first wrote to congratulate him for shouldering a prefect's responsibility, since he was afraid that Ron might have taken the \"Fred and George route\", deciding to cause trouble at school. He also urged Ron to break off all contact with Harry Potter, fearing that, since Harry had been tried by the Wizengamot for using underage magic, and in Percy's opinion was acquitted on a \"mere technicality\", their friendship would threaten Ron's position as a prefect, and even possibly a future appointment as Head Boy. Percy also commented that Dumbledore's time at Hogwarts could be coming to an end, with veiled hints concerning the introduction of the Hogwarts High Inquisitor post. Percy proceeded to tell Ron to make himself useful to Professor Umbridge, believing that she would set Hogwarts on the path to a bright future. While Harry brushed the letter off as a joke, Ron took Percy's writings as a personal affront; he scowled more and more as he read the letter, looked disgusted at the end, and angrily tore it up into eight pieces before throwing them into the fire in the Gryffindor common room. To Ron, the letter confirmed Percy's dishonesty and elitism. The letter greatly hurt Harry's feelings, however, as he saw how his words about Lord Voldemort returning were being ruthlessly criticised in writings, especially by a former friend."

It is believed that the room is Unplottable, as it does not appear on the Marauder's Map, nor do its occupants, although this could simply be because James Potter, Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew never found the room. The way to open the room is to walk past it three times thinking about what one needs, and the door will appear. It is advised that the users of this room be very specific about what they are looking for, as it has been shown that other people can enter the room and see what the occupant is doing if they know how the room is being used.

Lee sprinkled his commentaries with a bit of Gryffindor bias, a shameless admiration for Angelina Johnson, and more than a few swear words at times, not always to the amusement of Professor McGonagall. Final standings in the competition were based on the total amount of points won over all matches played, rather than the number of victories. It was entirely possible for one team to lose to another, but still claim the Cup if their points from previous games had been high enough. The Quidditch Cup itself was an enormous, silver trophy cup, with four handles designed after the four Houses' emblematic animals. Quidditch results were important not only for the pride of winning the Quidditch Cup, but also because there were House Points at stake. It was never made clear how many points were awarded for Quidditch victories, but when Harry was docked fifty points by Professor McGonagall for running round the Astronomy Tower at 1:00 in the morning, he worried that he'd lost the lead he gained through his last Quidditch victory.

Severus Snape was made Head of Slytherin at the remarkably young age of twenty-one, when he only just returned to Hogwarts. When Slughorn returned in 1996, Snape jealously guarded the prerogatives of the Headship, suggesting the teacher may not have to retire to lose the role. A Head of House was charged with monitoring and maintaining the welfare, safety, and discipline of all members of their designated House, as well as corresponding with the parents of said students whenever necessary. They needed to be nearby for emergency situations, such as when they informed students of new safety measures in the 1992\u20131993 school year. It is unlikely that they could be far from the Hogwarts/Hogsmeade area for too long, except during holidays.

Mandrakes not only resembled humans, but also had similar behaviours to them. In the 1992-1993 school year at Hogwarts, the school's Mandrakes, at one point of time, became moody and secretive, which indicated that they were reaching adolescence. Later on, they threw a loud and raucous party, which was comparable to humans when they are teenagers, which made Professor Sprout very happy indeed. When matured, Mandrakes could be cut up to serve as a prime ingredient for the Mandrake Restorative Draught, which was used to cure those who have been petrified.

The Whomping Willow was a very valuable, very violent tree planted alone in the middle of the school grounds. It was planted the same year that Remus Lupin arrived at Hogwarts (c. 1971) to disguise the opening to a secret passage from Hogwarts to the Shrieking Shack.

Ollivander was widely considered the best wandmaker in the world, and many wizards and witches bought their wands from him. Garrick Ollivander was born to Gervaise Ollivander, a wizard, and his wife, a Muggle-born witch, on the 25 September, in or before the year 1909. The surname means 'he who owns the olive wand' which is of Mediterranean origin, suggesting that the family emigrated to Britain from elsewhere, probably arriving in Britain with the Romans and set up a shop, to sell wands that were superior to the unreliable, poorly constructed ones fashioned by British wizards at the time. Soon, he developed an ambition to improve upon the cores and wand woods he made and developed a determination to pursue the ideal wand. Before Garrick Ollivander's proprietorship of Ollivanders, wizards used a wide variety of wand cores; the customer would often present their wandmaker with a magical substance to which they were attached, and he would turn it into their wand core. Mr Ollivander believed that doing so altered the wand's temperament, and he revolutionised the way wands were crafted by having cores of immensely powerful magical substances expertly enclosed in specially selected and complementary wandwoods, with the result being that the wand would be matched to an owner that the wand itself felt an affinity for. While there was initially substantial resistance to this new way wands were made, it soon became clear that wands made by Ollivander were far superior to any others."

After the feast, the headmaster would say a few more words; if he or she was feeling particularly festive, they would direct the students as they sang the school song, such as the year Harry Potter came to Hogwarts. Dumbledore used his wand as a conductor's baton, conjuring a ribbon that floated in the air, forming the words for the students to sing along with, each singing to the tune of their choice. Not all Professors were overly fond of the song, but Albus Dumbledore, the wise and odd man he was, conducted the singing with gusto and even teared up in the end:\nFirst-year students had to take: Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, History of Magic, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Astronomy, and Herbology, classes that were mandatory throughout their first five years of magical education. First-years, and only first-years, were required to take Flying class, where they learned the basic commands to give to their broomstick, as well as basic tricks and tips for riding, as most of the first-years have probably never flown before arriving at Hogwarts school.

  "summary": "The rose is the common name of a flowering shrub in the genus Rosa, of which over a hundred different species exist. Their petals were used in Zygmunt Budge's variation of the Beautification Potion, perfumes, and some varieties of Love Potion. Rose thorns could also be used in the latter, though, in the opinion of Zygmunt Budge, Love Potions made with the thorns tended to be more short-lasting and unstable. The Herbivicus Charm could also be used to rapidly accelerate the growth of roses. Around Valentine's Day in 1989, to celebrate the holiday, classes in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry provided subject-related lessons, Professor Pomona Sprout taught fifth years how to magically grow red roses with the Herbivicus Charm in Herbology. When Tom Riddle visited Hepzibah Smith on behalf of Borgin and Burkes, he conjured a bouquet of roses to present to her, a successful attempt of flattery on his part. This was apparently common at their meetings, as Hepzibah had already prepared a vase to hold the roses. On 31 July 1992, Harry Potter was forced to prune and water these roses, along with other menial household chores by Petunia Dursley, as punishment for scaring Dudley with the nonsense incantations jiggery pokery, Hocus Pocus and squiggly wiggly."

When Hannah Abbott asked for a shortcut to somewhere near the Room of Requirement so she was not caught by Dolores Umbridge, Harry Potter told her about this portrait. There was another portrait of him hung at the Viaduct Entrance, hiding a shortcut to the Grand Staircase. Not hiding any shortcut, this portrait knew about the current events at Hogwarts School and liked to help students keeping out of trouble, if they proved to him they weren't \"scoundrels,\" that is. The following school year, 1996-1997, von Rheticus's portrait had been moved to the Entrance Hall, this time hiding a way to the Portrait Room. As a portrait, he was very helpful and did not mind helping Hogwarts students when they needed it.

She lived near Harry Potter and the Dursley family, and used to babysit Harry in the 1980s and the early 1990s, mainly to keep an eye on him for Albus Dumbledore. As Dumbledore had believed Harry was too young to understand his place in the wizarding world, Mrs Figg kept her true identity a secret throughout most of Harry's childhood, and he knew nothing about her affiliation to the wizarding world until after he and Dudley Dursley were attacked by dementors in 1995. It is possible that she became a member of the Order of the Phoenix in the First Wizarding War, although her most notable contribution to the cause was taking up residence in Little Whinging, most probably on Albus Dumbledore's orders, to keep an eye on young Harry Potter. During times when the Dursley family went on holiday, they left Harry Potter with Mrs Figg, who once gave him an ancient chocolate cake as a \"treat\" but most often bored him senseless with pictures of her part-kneazle cats. She found treating him in that way difficult, and regretted it, but felt it was necessary  to ensure that the Dursleys would not withdraw Harry from her care.

When Amelia Bones, Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, was murdered by Voldemort in the summer of 1996, Thicknesse was appointed her successor, presumably by then-Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour. When one takes into consideration that the Department of Magical Law Enforcement is the largest Ministry department (to which the remaining six departments are all, in some respect, answerable with the possible exception of the Department of Mysteries), it seems to be safe to presume Thicknesse was high up at the Ministry at the time of his appointment in 1996. In the summer of 1997, as part of Voldemort's plan to take over the Ministry, Death Eater Yaxley placed the Imperius Curse on Thicknesse. He mentioned that this was more difficult than he had expected and had to do it with \"great effort\" (as Thicknesse's great strength of will allowed him to resist), which made him very nearly late for an important Death Eater meeting at Malfoy Manor. Many of the other Death Eaters were impressed with Yaxley's work, Antonin Dolohov clapping him on the back in congratulations, but Voldemort pointed out that Thicknesse was only one man, as well as that he needed Minister Rufus Scrimgeour surrounded by his agents before he acted. As head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse had regular contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the Heads of all the other Ministry departments, making it easier to subjugate the others."

During the course of his last year at Hogwarts, he also became a member of the Slug Club, escorted Hermione Granger to the club's Christmas party, and was primarily responsible for the Gryffindor Quidditch team's embarrassing loss to Hufflepuff by hitting Harry Potter (seeker at the time) over the head with a beater's bat. Like most Gryffindor students, McLaggen participated in the final battle of the Second Wizarding War and fought alongside the defenders of Hogwarts. Little is known of McLaggen's early life, though it appears that he was born into a relatively influential wizarding family, as his uncle Tiberius was an important official in the Ministry of Magic and was friendly with the head of the Auror Office and later Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour. Cormac McLaggen started his education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1990 and was Sorted into Gryffindor, along with Katie Bell who also was a Sorted Gryffindor that year. In 1995\u20131996 school year, McLaggen's sixth year at Hogwarts, he ate a pound of poisonous Doxy eggs on a bet to prove his bravery. With Oliver Wood's graduation at the end of the 1993\u20131994 school year and the Triwizard Tournament cancelling all Quidditch matches the following year, the Gryffindor team was in need of a Keeper at the beginning of the 1995\u20131996 school year."

When she was eleven, Angelina was accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and visited Diagon Alley to purchase the required equipment for school, including her wand. Angelina began attending Hogwarts in 1989, when she was nearly twelve years old, and was sorted into Gryffindor House. At some point in her education, Angelina Johnson borrowed Quidditch Through the Ages from the Hogwarts Library, and was due to return the book on 19 July. Angelina was a popular student, and friends with fellow Gryffindors Alicia Spinnet, Fred and George Weasley, Katie Bell, and Lee Jordan; the latter appeared to be attracted to Angelina, making various admiring comments about her when he commentated on Quidditch games. Angelina did not like the way that Oliver Wood referred to his players as \"men\" or \"lads\", as she, along with Katie Bell and Alicia Spinnet were female players and she would often have to correct him whilst he gave motivational speeches before games in the locker rooms. In 1991, the famous Harry Potter would arrive at Hogwarts, and after Professor McGonagall witnessed his flying skills, she appointed him Seeker for the team and Angelina would play alongside him in his first game. During an early Quidditch match, Severus Snape officiated instead of Madam Hooch and he called a penalty against Angelina during a Hufflepuff-Gryffindor game."

Jacob's sibling played Beater for their House during the 1986\u20131987 school year, replacing Bean, who was suspended from playing Quidditch for the season due to her low marks. Beaters needed to be well built, having considerable physical strength in their arms since they were charged with hitting the Bludgers throughout the whole match. Because of this, most of the beaters throughout history had been wizards rather than witches playing in this position. Beaters also needed to have good balance, as they were, at times, required to take both hands off their broomstick."

The position of the Seeker, known as the Hunter, was introduced in response to Barberus Bragge's introduction of the Golden Snidget during a match in 1269 making it the newest position in the game. The 1269 game mentioned above was attended by Barberus Bragge, the Chief of the Wizards' Council. As a nod to the sport of Snidget-hunting, which was also popular at the time, Bragge brought such a bird to the game and released it from its cage. He told the players that one-hundred fifty Galleons \u2014 a large sum of money, particularly in those times \u2014 would be awarded to the player who caught the bird. What happened at the Quidditch game in question was rather predictable: the players totally ignored the game, and each and every one simply went off in pursuit of the Snidget, which was kept within the arena by the crowd using Repelling Charms. A witch named Modesty Rabnott, who was also watching the game, took pity on the Snidget and rescued it with a Summoning Charm before rushing away with it hidden inside her robes. She was caught by a furious Bragge and fined ten Galleons for disrupting the game, but not before she had released the Snidget. This saved the life of this bird, but the connection with Quidditch had been made, and soon a Snidget was being released at every game."

Barty begged his father to set him free, but Crouch Snr felt betrayed by his son and thought he deserved to be punished and imprisoned. However, Barty\u2019s mother, already dying at the time, persuaded her husband to use Polyjuice Potion to switch her for their son, in case any of the prisoners were watching through their cells. They only recognised a healthy person and a dying person (Barty Snr and his wife) entering the fortress, and a healthy person and a dying person (Barty Snr and his son) leaving. Mrs Crouch, disguised as Barty, died a few days later and was buried outside the fortress still bearing her son's appearance. In 1993, Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban after seeing Scabbers in a Daily Prophet article of the paper Cornelius Fudge gave him in late July 1993, recognising him as his traitorous former friend Peter Pettigrew. By 31 July, Black took advantage of his extreme weight loss to slip through his cell door in his Animagus dog form (which was unregistered, thus the Ministry did not take preparations against) while the Dementors were bringing in his food and swam across the North Sea to find Pettigrew."

Muggle-borns inherited magic from a distant ancestor; they were descended from Squibs who had married Muggles and whose families had lost the knowledge of their wizarding legacy. Because of the heritable traits of magic, Muggle-born siblings were possible, as in the case of Colin and Dennis Creevey. When Muggle-born witches and wizards reached the age of eleven in the British wizarding community, their Hogwarts acceptance letters were delivered in person by a member of the staff, instead of by owl post (the usual postal system for wizards and witches).

There was also an International Gobstones League, officiated from the Official Gobstones Club Offices, on the Department of Magical Games and Sports (level seven of the Ministry of Magic).

The night that followed turned out to be the major upheaval of Bagnold's term in office since wizards up and down the country started celebrating Voldemort's downfall and the end of the First Wizarding War in what became \"a night of large-scale breaches of the International Wizarding Statute of Secrecy\" Bagnold defended these celebrations by famously stating that she asserted the wizards' \"inalienable right to party.\" It was also during her term in office that Death Eaters Igor Karkaroff, Rodolphus, Rabastan, Bellatrix Lestrange, as well as Bartemius Crouch Jnr were rounded up and tried before the Council of Magical Law and sent to Azkaban. In the early 1980s, Bartemius Crouch Snr was very likely to succeed Bagnold, but his popularity was tarnished after the scandal in which he sent his own son to Azkaban. Albus Dumbledore also had a lot of popular support to be her successor, but he never expressed any desire to take the Minister's job, so Cornelius Fudge took the post instead.

When she made a Prophecy that impressed Dumbledore, she was granted the position (though the true reason was to protect her from Lord Voldemort, who was desperate to hear the rest of the prophecy). Students studied a myriad of ways to scry information about the future, including tea dregs, crystal balls, visions, and Astrology and horoscope charts. Other methods of divining the future included smoke patterns, dreams, tarot cards, and the interpretation of prophecies, though the latter is quite rare. Some students, such as Percy Weasley, thought the subject very useful, especially when thinking about the future, while others, such as the trio, could not achieve any success in this course, and regretted ever taking it. Hermione Granger eventually dropped the class, while Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, in order to scrape a pass in the course, merely made up plenty of things when it comes to predicting the future, not taking the work seriously. They usually added plenty of tragedies, so Professor Trelawney would be satisfied, despite the false predictions could be far-fetched. They would also make fun out of the class whenever possible, as when Ron saw nothing but thick white swirl in the crystal ball, he joked about foreseeing a very foggy night, to which his friends laughed. Due to lack of interest leading to poor efforts, Harry was among the known students to have failed his Divination O.W.L., and ceased taking any advanced studies."

Harry longed for the bedroom for a long time, however, at the time he received it, he only wished he could read his letter from Hogwarts. While Harry was on holidays during the summer of 1992, he was ordered to stay inside his bedroom because the Dursleys had some important visitors: Mr and Mrs .Mason. This proved difficult however, because, upon entering his room, Harry discovered Dobby the house-elf waiting for him on his bed. Dobby was there to warn Harry implicitly of Tom Riddle and Lucius Malfoy's, plot involving the Chamber of Secrets and Voldemort's eventual return by telling not to return. Because Harry refused to promise to not return to Hogwarts, Dobby levitated the dessert Petunia Dursley had made and dropped it, making it crash on the floor."

On 6 June, they played Bulgaria in the first quarterfinal, losing 20 to 170 in what was considered one of the tournament's biggest upsets, due to Norway's status as joint favourites and many saying Bulgaria was lucky to qualify. Although Bulgarian Chaser Nikola Vassileva scored twice early in the game, Lundekvam quickly equalised. When Bulgarian Seeker Viktor Krum dived for the Snitch, Kristoffersen thought he was avoiding a bludger, so did not even look at him until Krum revealed that he had won the game in the 42nd minute, which she responded to by flying to the ground and banging her head on it until Karl Wang, the Keeper, dragged her to her feet."

Muntz played piggie-in-the-middle with the other team's Chaser(s), while sliding the Quaffle down her outstretched arms and behind her head. She threw it to Fedele, who threw it to Green, who scored by throwing the Quaffle in from behind the goal post after diving off of his broomstick, while falling. Muntz took it and scored once again, the other team's Keeper diving off their broom, but failing to make the save. The American team's national stadium appeared to be on a New England farm, with a barn behind one goal and a road leading to a hilltop Victorian mansion behind the other, heavily implying that the stadium and field were privately owned (a possible nod to America's emphasis on private, rather than state-run enterprise). The bottom of the Quidditch pitch was covered with dirt and quite a few weeds and mowed-down crops, and the pitch itself sported line markers similar to those seen on an American football field circa 1920. Given the farm buildings and the ploughed dirt nature of the field, it is likely that the field was used to grow crops in the off-season."

Growing up as the youngest of nine sisters, she often found it difficult to get her older sisters to listen to her, and sometimes relied on this spell to silence them long enough to allow her to speak. For example, she cast it on her sister Diadema to get her to return clothing she borrowed without permission; on her sister Romilda to get her to keep out of her room when she did not want to be disturbed; and on her sister Tangwystl when she wanted to keep her quiet so that she could do her homework. Sometime between its invention and the late 1990s, the Bat-Bogey Hex had been involved in several notable incidents throughout wizarding history. Ginny Weasley was a noted practitioner of the hex, and used it to good effect on at least two occasions. The first use was to overpower Draco Malfoy in Dolores Umbridge's office during her tyrannical tenure as Headmistress of Hogwarts, allowing herself, her brother Ron, and their companions, Neville Longbottom, and Luna Lovegood, to escape from her office after they were held there by members of Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad. The second occasion was used on Zacharias Smith, who annoyed Ginny on the Hogwarts Express by asking her exactly what occurred at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Ginny may have also used this spell on her brother George, as he once mentioned her skill to her future husband Harry Potter. In the 21st century, Ginny Weasley taught the Bat-Bogey Hex to members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force who pursued an Auror profession, in order to help address the results of the Calamity."

 "confundus charm": {
  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Confundus_Charm",
  "summary": "There were varying degrees of confusion that could be caused by the spell, ranging from becoming unaware of the current situation, forgetting important information, or becoming particularly impressionable. For instance, when Newt Scamander and Hermione Granger used it to bypass wizarding security officers (though both of whom were notably very skilled with charms), be it in order to pass by unnoticed or by making them think they had already gone through the security check, it was typically a simple matter of quickly pointing their wands at the target and cast it quickly and discreetly. When, however, Severus Snape sought to imprint an elaborate plan onto Mundungus Fletcher and trick him into thinking that not only was the plan of his making, but to give him the idea of proposing it to the Order of the Phoenix, he had to give such considerable focus to the task that he had to \"frown in concentration\". It would cause any of varying degrees of confusion, from a simple trick to making a person believe that they had come up with a complex plan when said plan was given to them by the caster. Not only did the spell work on living creatures, but it also was able to affect sentient objects, as demonstrated when Barty Crouch Junior Confunded the Goblet of Fire, though this was noted to be a difficult task, as the Goblet itself was a powerful magical artefact. During the 1989\u20131990 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Filius Flitwick taught this charm to fifth year students in Charms class, in preparation for their upcoming Ordinary Wizarding Levels. In 1994, after the encounter at the Shrieking Shack in Hogsmeade, Severus Snape expressed his belief that Sirius Black had used the charm to bewitch Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger after the three of them attacked Snape with the Disarming Charm in the shack. Confundus, as well as the incantation Confundo, are derived from the Latin verb c\u014dnfundere (c\u014dnfund\u014d - c\u014dnfundere - c\u014dnf\u016bd\u012b - c\u014dnf\u016bsum), meaning \"to confuse, to perplex.\""

 "boggart": {

  "summary": "When facing a Boggart, it was best to have someone else along, to try to confuse it, since facing more than one person at once made it indecisive towards determining what form it should take, usually resulting in a not frightening combination of the victims' fears. Much like Poltergeists, Boggart were non-beings, who, although they resembled living creatures, were not considered magically \"alive\" and were as a result amortal (a Boggart could be made to disappear with the Boggart-Banishing Spell, but it would inevitably reappear, with several more by its side at times). Much like Poltergeists with mischief and Dementors with gloom and depression, Boggarts seemed to embody the human emotion of fear, and consequently feed on other beings' fears. Secondly, though a Boggart who transforms into a magical being or object can replicate its abilities to an extent, this will be a weaker facsimile of the real thing; thus, a Boggart transformed into a Dementor has weaker magic than a real Dementor (according to Professor Lupin, who exploited this effect to simulate a Dementor attack in Harry's presence to help him perfect the use of the Patronus Charm at no serious risk to Harry Potter's soul.) For example, in August 1995, when Molly Weasley was attempting to banish a boggart that had taken up residence in 12 Grimmauld Place, the Boggart took the form of the freshly dead bodies of her family, as well as Harry Potter, whom she loved like a son. The extent of Boggarts' intelligence was unclear; though they sometimes took the forms of sentient beings as part of their fear-inducing transformations; those false \"people\" appeared to be little more than caricatures, acting out the motions of the victim's fear involving said people, heedless of their surroundings."

  "summary": "Some of the covert research projects this department undertook were revealed to Dumbledore's Army, and an important battle of the Second Wizarding War took place within the department in 1996. Due to the highly classified nature of this department, it was granted a great deal of independence, being the only one within the entire Ministry that did not need to answer to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Even the Minister for Magic had very little authority over the department's operations, as the fifteenth Minister's attempt to shut down the branch was ignored by the Unspeakables. The Department of Mysteries lay on the second-lowest level of the Ministry of Magic, Level Nine. This level bore a striking difference to those above: the black-tiled walls were bare with no windows and no doors, apart from a plain black one at the end of the corridor that led into the Department proper. It was a circular room with a dark marble floor that looked almost like standing water, candles emitting a cool blue light, and twelve handleless doors."

  "summary": "Important witches and wizards from Germany included:\nIn medieval Germany, the ancient game of Stichstock, a forerunner of modern Quidditch, was popular. Quidditch became popular on the continent, and thus probably also in Germany, by the early 15th century. After the Harpies beat the Harriers, Harriers' Captain Rudolf Brand proposed to the Harpies' Captain and was hit over the head with her Cleansweep Five. The broomstick manufacturing company Ellerby and Spudmore resided in the Black Forest, but their brooms were never successful in professional Quidditch. An illuminated manuscript dating back to early Medieval Ages that depicted three warlocks dismounting from their brooms was found in Germany. Based on the name of the school, it is possible that German wizards and witches had the option to attend Durmstrang Institute. By the 1920s, Aurors from Germany were active in the wizarding world. In the 21st century, a branch of bowtruckles was unleashed as a Confoundable by the Calamity and had to be dealt with by the Statute of Secrecy Task Force and returned to the Black Forest in Germany."

Harry Potter received one from Minerva McGonagall, when he joined the Gryffindor Quidditch team as the new Seeker. Harry fell off the broom when dementors appeared on the pitch, and it struck the Whomping Willow.

The Bloody Baron had fallen in love with Helena Ravenclaw, but she did not reciprocate and rejected his many advances, the last one leading to his impulsively killing her, then killing himself out of regret. Rowena Ravenclaw loved her daughter Helena greatly, as she never revealed her daughter's betrayal and desertion to others, and fell fatally ill from what legends describe as a \"broken heart\". Even in her deathbed, Rowena disregarded Helena's betrayal and her last wish was to simply see her daughter one more time. Cadmus Peverell fell in love with a woman, but she died of unknown causes before the two could be wed. After either creating or been given the Resurrection Stone by Death, he used it in an attempt to bring his late lover back to him, but this \"revival\" was incomplete and she was sad and cold, giving off the feeling of the two were still separated. Cadmus was driven mad by being unable to be with his love in this life, so he committed suicide by hanging himself from rafters to be truly reunited with her in the next life. Around 1634, Gormlaith Gaunt tracked down Isolt Sayre (her niece who had escaped her) and placed her and her husband, Muggle James Steward, under a powerful curse that kept them in a deep sleep. Though it seemed nothing could wake them, the screams of their daughters broke through the enchantment, awakening the power of love. Also during this time, Webster Boot fell in love with a Scottish witch and the two married, settled in Britain, and had children together."

  "summary": "The Muggle-Born Registration Commission was set up by the Ministry of Magic following Lord Voldemort's takeover on 1 August, 1997. The public goal of the Commission was to force all Muggle-born wizards and witches to register with the Ministry, then undergo interrogation as to how they \"stole\" their magical power from \"real\" wizards and witches. In truth, the Commission was a deeply prejudicial institution, that focused its resources on degradation and imprisonment of Muggle-borns. The Muggle-Born signup was set up within a month of Lord Voldemort taking over the Ministry of Magic, supposedly because the Department of Mysteries conducted research which found that magic could only be inherited and thus any \"so-called Muggle-born\" must have obtained magic by thievery. In reality, the Commission was an instrument of discrimination against Muggle-borns in line with Death Eater ideology. Although they claimed to have \"issued an invitation\" for Muggle-borns to meet with the Commission, the Commission in fact forced Muggle-borns to turn themselves in, sending Snatchers against any who tried to avoid them. Furthermore, their \"interviews\" were shams, fully intent on sending innocent Muggle-borns to Azkaban, or stripping them of their wands and jobs, leaving them impoverished. Despite Ronald Weasley believing the claims within the news to be too ludicrous for people to accept, let alone permit, the community nevertheless accepted the Commission's foundation and Muggle-borns were arrested. Furthermore, pure-bloods who have pro-muggle ideals are kept on constant surveillance by the Commission, as they are blood traitors, which the Ministry's new regime considers unacceptable. Luckily, half-bloods, despite being against the Death Eaters' ideology of purity, are allowed to remain as citizens within the community, as they technically have \"legally inherited\" magic, though they are treated with less respect due to dilution."

 "mudblood": {
  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Mudblood",
  "summary": "Mudblood was a highly derogatory term for a Muggle-born or half-blood, wizard or witch; that is, individuals with close Muggle relatives. While there did not appear to be any difference in the magical power of Muggle-borns and half-bloods compared to those who were pure-blood, pure-blood supremacists still considered them to be of \"lower breeding\" or worth, and undeserving of magic. Many older wizarding families placed great emphasis on blood purity and rejected association with Muggles and Muggle-borns, both of whom they considered greatly inferior to themselves. Notably, some pure-bloods, such as members of the Weasley family, rejected these prejudices and were labelled \"blood traitors\" or \"Mudblood-lovers\" as a result. The term \"Mudblood\" was generally not used in polite society, as it was considered highly offensive and vulgar, on par with the racial epithets often heard in the Muggle world. When Draco Malfoy called Hermione Granger a Mudblood in 1992, he was nearly attacked by several members of the Gryffindor Quidditch team and was nearly cursed by Ronald Weasley. This was in line with Death Eater ideology being disseminated to the general public, which claimed that Muggle-borns were not \"real\" wizards and witches. For example, Lily Evans told her former friend Severus Snape that if he was going to refer to other Muggle-borns as \"Mudbloods\", then he had to use the term for her as well, and Hermione Granger declared that she was proud to be a \"Mudblood\" in 1998."

According to the wizarding journalist Rita Skeeter, in a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time, Grindelwald would miss out on the top spot only because Voldemort arrived, a generation later, to take his crown. For example, Peter Pettigrew was in Gryffindor, yet he betrayed the Order of the Phoenix and joined Voldemort; Quirinus Quirrell, a Ravenclaw, also allied himself with the Dark Lord; and (albeit only in an alternate timeline) Cedric Diggory from Hufflepuff would become a Death Eater, whereas Slytherins such as Horace Slughorn, Regulus Black, Andromeda Tonks and later Severus Snape opposed the Death Eaters and fought against them."

By the spring of 1998, Voldemort was in control of the Ministry of Magic and had Snatchers prowling the country in search of Muggle-borns, blood traitors and Undesirable Number One, Harry Potter. Harry, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger were secretly hunting down Voldemort's Horcruxes in an effort to make him mortal and defeat him once and for all. Harry accidentally triggered the Taboo curse on Voldemort's name, and he and his friends were immediately surrounded by a gang of Snatchers led by Fenrir Greyback. Thinking fast, Hermione used a Stinging Hex on Harry's face in an attempt to disguise his identity. Harry, thinking quickly, claimed that he was \"Vernon Dudley\", the son of a Ministry employee, and a Slytherin, a claim he was able to back up because he knew where the Slytherin common room was from having been there in his second year. Ron said he was \"Stan Shunpike\", but the Snatchers knew he was lying and punched him in the face; Ron then claimed he was \"Barny Weasley\".

During his funeral, directly after a Ceremony official gave his eulogy, his body was encased in bright white flames that gave off smoke in strange patterns, and Harry Potter thought he saw the form of a phoenix fly out of the blaze. However, Voldemort eventually deduced that Dumbledore had won the Elder Wand from Grindelwald, who himself stole it from Gregorovitch. Voldemort flew to Hogwarts and used his own wand to crack open the White Tomb from head to foot, and then removed the sheets from around Dumbledore's body, allowing him to take the wand within, which had been buried with its owner. Following Voldemort's death on 2 May at the conclusion of the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter, the one who had slain Voldemort utilising his mastership of the Elder Wand, returned the wand to the White Tomb, restoring it and ensuring Dumbledore's resting place would remain undisturbed."

Voldemort then left, leaving Kreacher to drink from the lake (as any water conjured evaporated) and die at the hands of the Inferi. However, Voldemort, in his arrogance, had never cared to learn that House Elves can apparate out of locations that Wizards and Witches cannot, so Kreacher, using his own special type of magic and not contained by the enchantments on the cave, was able to Disapparate from the cave and follow his master's orders, to \"come home when he finished his task\".

Through his eldest daughter, he is the grandfather of Delphini, who was fathered by Voldemort as a result of their affair at Malfoy Manor. Through his disowned daughter and his youngest daughter, Cygnus is the grandfather of Nymphadora Tonks and Draco Malfoy respectively, and is also the great-grandfather of Teddy Lupin and Scorpius Malfoy, respectively. He died in 1992, when his grandson was attending his first or second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Like many other members of the House of Black, Cygnus is named after a constellation. It was named for several swans which appear in Greek mythology, including the one Zeus transformed into to seduce Leda, the form Orpheus took after his death, and a son of the god Apollo who was turned into a swan after his murder."

By 1943, the members of the Riddle family were generally disliked if not outright hated by the villagers that lived in the area. They were also hated by the members of the House of Gaunt, an ancient pure-blood wizarding family; the Gaunts loathed Muggles on principle, but the Riddles didn't endear themselves to the Gaunts by constantly mocking their poverty and mental instability. Around 1925, Tom Riddle Snr had a possible lover by the name of Cecilia. Afterwards, Merope either dosed Tom with Love Potion or cast the Imperius Curse on him, thereby forcing him to marry her (Albus Dumbledore speculated that the former method was more likely).

After Morfin and Marvolo Gaunt were imprisoned in Azkaban, Merope made a romantic and magical play for Riddle by using a Love Potion to obtain his affection. Once the effects of the potion wore off on him, Tom soon returned to the Riddle House, however, having abandoned his wife and unborn child, Tom Marvolo Riddle. In the summer of 1943, sixteen-year-old Tom Marvolo Riddle, whose mother had died shortly after giving birth, came to Little Hangleton in search of his family. Riddle visited the Gaunt Shack and found his maternal uncle, Morfin Gaunt, living in deplorable conditions. Morfin immediately mistook Riddle for his father, Tom Riddle Snr, saying that he looked very much like \"that Muggle that married my sister\". Upon learning of Riddle Snr's actions toward his mother and himself, Riddle stunned his uncle, took his wand, and proceeded to \"the big house over the way\" that Morfin had told him about to confront his father with murder in his heart."

After Molly cast a well-aimed lethal spell at Bellatrix, she toppled lifeless to the ground, making Voldemort scream in fury and point his wand at Mrs Weasley. After the Battle of Hogwarts recommenced, the arrival of the Hogwarts Centaur herd, Grawp, and the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade forced the battle to move inside the Castle, with duellers being forced into the Great Hall by the charging forces. Fifty yards away from Lord Voldemort, who duelled against Minerva McGonagall, Horace Slughorn and Kingsley Shacklebolt, Bellatrix Lestrange started a duel against Hermione Granger, Ginevra Weasley and Luna Lovegood, all three girls combining their best efforts to defeat her. Molly Weasley witnessed this and, enraged at the Death Eater, ran towards her shouting \"Not my daughter, you bitch!\".

The class was scheduled to begin study of the Creatures on 5 November, 1993; however, Professor Lupin was absent due to his illness and Professor Snape took the class instead. The class found the creature rather frail and harmless-looking, although Professor Lupin warned them of how the Hinkypunk would lure travellers ahead with its lantern, although exactly what would happen thereafter was left ambiguous, as the creature then made a loud squelching noise against the glass. Hinkypunks were later included in the third year exams for Defence Against the Dark Arts in June of 1994, the second-to-last exam. Professor Lupin had created an obstacle course in the sun, and included an artificial bog, into which a Hinkypunk was placed.

Operating as something akin to treasure-hunting archaeologists, Gringotts's Curse-Breakers were tasked with venturing through tombs, caves, mountains, deserts and forests and the like in search of old treasure troves from which the bank might make a profit, and specialised in the removal of magical security measures placed upon such areas. Not a very formal affair, Curse-Breakers did not have any form of formal uniform, seen as how the Goblins running generally cared little about what they look like in terms of appearance or dress, as long as they bring much treasure back to the bank. it was, however, nevertheless widely considered to be a very serious profession due to the amount of danger involved, as in addition to the risk they all ran of being killed as a result of an old curse left to protect their objectives, they would also encounter and have to deal with a great many dark or otherwise dangerous creatures, artefacts. Presumably, N.E.W.T.s in Defence Against the Dark Arts, Potions, Transfiguration, and Charms would be necessary, given the dangerous aspects of the job, as well as one in Ancient Runes, however, this is unknown for certain.

Time was governed by natural laws which magic could explore and, to a certain and limited degree, manipulate, and, as such, there was a room devoted to its study in the Department of Mysteries, the Time Room. Time-related magic was unstable, however, and as serious breaches in the laws of time was widely accepted to potentially result in catastrophe if meddled with, the investigations conducted in the Department of Mysteries was largely shrouded in mystery. At one point, it was noted, however, that whereas magic made it possible to go back in time, their researched had showed that a prospective time traveller could go back for a period of no more than five hours, as any further meant that the person in question would run the risk of doing great damage to both themselves and time itself. Consequently, the use of Time-Turners, which could only take the user back in time and not into the future, since they were charmed with an Hour-Reversal Charm, were hedged around with hundreds of laws. The Ministry of Magic had a great deal of trouble covering up the mishap and, since then, the most stringent laws and penalties have been placed around those who study time travel. Hermione Granger received a Time-Turner from Professor McGonagall in 1993, so that she could attend more classes in her third year than time would allow. Since McGonagall made her swear to not tell anyone about it, she did not mention it to Harry or Ron until the end of the school year, when she and Harry used it to travel back in time and save Sirius Black and Buckbeak from certain death."

The island in the North Sea on which the wizard prison was built had never appeared on any map, wizard or Muggle. Its first known resident, Ekrizdis, practised the worst kinds of Dark magic and constructed a fortress on the island, luring Muggle sailors there to torture and murder them. After his death, the various concealment charms placed on the island faded, and the Ministry of Magic became aware of the mysterious site's existence. Those who entered the deserted fortress to investigate discovered, among other horrors, an infestation of Dementors. The wizarding authorities of the time considered destroying the fortress, but, fearing reprisal by the dark entities or the island itself, decided against such action, and the Ministry allowed the sizeable colony to remain; the island was thus left unmolested and unchecked for many years, perhaps decades, until the International Statute of Secrecy was established."

Ever since the early fifteenth century, the persecution of witches and wizards gathered pace all over Europe, making many in the wizarding community feel, and justifiably so, that offering to aid their Muggle neighbours with their magic was tantamount to volunteering to fetch the firewood for one's own funeral pyre: many witches and wizards were locked up and sentenced to death on the charge of witchcraft. Widespread persecution of wizarding children by Muggles, escalating attempts by Muggles to force witches and wizards to perform magic for Muggle ends and teach them magic, increasing numbers of witch-burnings, including those of Muggles mistakenly burned as witches, were the catalysts for some kind of measure to be taken. In Great Britain, the newly-created Ministry of Magic attempted to liaise with the Muggle British Monarch (then jointly William III and Mary II) via a special Ministry Delegation, begging them for the protection of wizards under Muggle law. After heated discussions in the Wizengamot (during which Ralston Potter came out as a great champion of the Statute of Secrecy, as opposed to more \"militant members\" who voiced their desire to declare war on the Muggles), the Statute was first signed in 1689, but it was only three years later, in 1692, that it was officially established and effectively started to be enforced by every Ministry of Magic. Despite their espousal of pure-blood values and their strong belief in wizards' superiority over Muggles, the Malfoys had always drawn a sharp distinction between poor Muggles and those with wealth and authority; they had historically been associated with high-born Muggle circles, such as royalty (William the Conqueror and Queen Elizabeth I being notable examples) and aristocracy, which, in part, resulted in their vast collection of Muggle treasures and works of art. Once the Statute was passed into law in 1692, however, the Malfoys cut off all ties with Muggle families, as they realised that further opposition would distance them from the new heart of power: the newly created Ministry of Magic."

  "summary": "It was sometimes spotted by Muggles though, due to its nature and the efforts of the Office of Misinformation, no conclusive proof of its existence has been leaked. Wizard observers from the International Confederation of Wizards discovered it was a Kelpie when they observed it changing into an otter on the approach of a team of Muggle investigators, then back into a Sea Serpent. The number of sightings by Muggles over the years has made it impossible to use Memory Charms to erase all record; therefore the Office of Misinformation has worked diligently to discredit any photographic evidence of \"Nessie\". These Muggle sightings of the creature are a large part of why Scotland is considered one of the most frequent national violators of Clause 73 of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy (the clause that ensures the secrecy of magical creatures)."

In order for someone to get onto Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, they had to walk directly at the apparently solid barrier dividing Platforms Nine and Ten. When returning from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, there was a guard stationed just outside the ticket barrier, in order to regulate exits from the platform through the gate, in order to not alarm the Muggles. However, every 1 September, as the clock overhead approaches eleven o\u2019clock, and the InterCity 125 pulls into platform nine. The crowd was wizarding children, bearing enormous trunks and caged owls and other unusual pets, making their way toward \u2014 and then through \u2014 the solid metal barrier between platforms nine and ten. Through this barrier, of course, lay Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, home of the famous Hogwarts Express. There, a look back at the barrier revealed it is instead a wrought-iron archway with the words \u201cPlatform Nine and Three-Quarters\u201d on it. Steam from the scarlet engine flooded the platform as cats wound their way around the wizards\u2019 legs and owls hooted to each other, as hoardes of students and parents moved around through the steam \u201clike dark ghosts\u201d, their voices carrying through the mist."

  "summary": "After being informed of their magical heritage by Rubeus Hagrid, they started attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 2008. During their childhood, their latent magical abilities often surfaced, which they believed was unusual, despite their parents being amused and not taking it seriously. During the summer of 2008, Rubeus Hagrid, the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, paid them a visit and delivered the Hogwarts acceptance letter. Being a Muggle-born, they were escorted to Diagon Alley by Hagrid on his flying motorbike to purchase their school stuff. When they were ready to return home, Hagrid's motorbike had trouble starting, so they used the London Underground. When they arrived at King's Cross Station on 1 September, they were unsure how to find Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. They successfully boarded the Hogwarts Express and arrived at Hogsmeade station, after which they crossed the Great Lake on a boat with other first-years and reached the Hogwarts Castle. Headmistress McGonagall led them into the Great Hall and delivered a speech, mentioning a grumpy ghoul having taken up residence in an empty classroom on the third floor, and assuring students that while they would hopefully never face such evil as in the Battle of Hogwarts, should challenges arise, the joint forces of them would be truly powerful. Ivy Warrington was at first not present at the ceremony, but she was later brought forward by Hagrid, who explained she had gotten distracted by bushes outside the castle, and was sorted into the same House."

When Minister for Magic Ottaline Gambol commandeered a Muggle train to serve as the new mode of transport for Hogwarts students, she also had constructed a small station in the wizarding village of Hogsmeade: a necessary adjunct to the train. The Ministry of Magic felt strongly, however, that to construct an additional wizarding station in the middle of London would stretch even the Muggles' notorious determination not to notice magic when it was exploding in front of their faces. It was Evangeline Orpington, Minister from 1849-1855, who hit upon the solution of adding a concealed platform at the newly built King's Cross station, which would be accessible only to witches and wizards. On the whole, this worked well, although there were some minor problems over the ensuing years, such as witches and wizards who dropped suitcases full of biting spellbooks or newt spleens all over the polished station floor, or else disappeared through the solid barrier a little too loudly. Platform 7\u00bd offered a long-distance train, similar to the Muggle Orient Express, off to wizard-only villages in continental Europe. The platform had a sign hanging over it, reading: Hogwarts Express, eleven o'clock, and there was a wrought iron archway bearing the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters over the entry/exit to the platform."

After her education at Hogwarts, she met and married Draco and the two had a son, Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy. Born into the Greengrass family, among the oldest, truly pure-blooded families in Britain, Astoria and her older sister, Daphne, were brought up in the ideals of Pure-blood supremacy. Astoria's life was cut short by a curse placed upon her ancestor long before her time, resulting in her body becoming extremely frail. The events of the Second Wizarding War during her teenage years made Astoria espouse a more tolerant life view, turning back on her family's blood purity ideals, although her experience through the war was less than that of what Draco Malfoy suffered. At some point between 2000 and 2005, she eventually married Draco Malfoy, who was two years ahead of her and was a classmate of her older sister, Daphne Greengrass. Frail, and knowing she was not destined for old age due to her ancestor's blood borne curse, Astoria longed for a child so that Draco, after her inevitable death, would not be alone."

Along the course of the school year, Professor Slughorn would hold various club get-togethers, often dinners with fine food and around 10 student-attendees. Professor Slughorn's aim was to cultivate talent and give his favourites a nudge toward fame and fortune, hoping to reap the benefits of his connection to them once they became the \"high fliers\" he expected them to be. On the 20th of December, 1996, there was a lavish party for past and present Slug Club members held in Professor Slughorn's office at Hogwarts. After Harry's failed attempt to get a particular memory out of the Professor, Slughorn apparently stopped these meetings in order to prevent giving Harry another attempt. It may have been disbanded due to the return of Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four, though the decree technically only affected student-founded clubs (such as Dumbledore's Army).

What truly made this phenomenon remarkable was the fact that viewers could witness every aspect of the memory as they saw fit from a third person perspective, even if the owner of the memory had little to no knowledge of what they were seeing, since one viewer was able to tail other people in the memory whilst the past version of the memory's owner was present at a fair distance away. The viewer was also intangible to all other physical matters and energies of the said memory, as Harry Potter was considered a phantom, invisible and intangible, to the rest of the past world he was viewing; a man shaking hands with Dumbledore went right through Harry's body, causing neither of them harm, and a later memory when Harry was phasing through many desks in the Great Hall while rushing to his past father's location, to which was described if done in the real world the desks would be sent flying. Memories could be read without the needs of extracting them, through the powers of Legilimency; however, those that were extracted and then deposited into a magical device like the Pensieve or a simple vial could no longer be viewed through this manner. A master Occlumens such as Severus Snape could choose what memories to suppress instead of completely blocking out Legilimency, so as to prevent the opposition from knowing crucial information without knowing that they were blocking it out on purpose.

However, that same day, the Death Eaters made use of the many high-ranking Ministry officials they had under the Imperius Curse, such as Pius Thicknesse, to execute a virtually silent coup d'\u00e9tat, taking over the Ministry. During the coup, the Death Eaters interrogated the Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour in the hope of extracting the location of Harry Potter. Using their newly acquired power that comes with having the full might of the Ministy under their control, the Death Eaters rapidly organised attacks on every residence connected to the Order of the Phoenix. Kingsley Shacklebolt, who presumably was at the Ministry when the coup took place, was able to send his Patronus to warn the attendees of the reception at the Burrow. Seconds later the Death Eaters Apparated there, crashed the reception, and began to attack the attendees. Many of the guests managed to escape, including Hermione Granger who Apparated herself, Harry Potter, and Ron Weasley to Tottenham Court Road, away from the chaos before they could be captured by Death Eaters."

Travers escaped from Azkaban after Lord Voldemort's return in 1995 and fought in several battles of the Second Wizarding War, including the Battle of the Seven Potters, the Ambush at the Lovegood House and the Battle of Hogwarts. During the First Wizarding War, Travers murdered the family of Marlene McKinnon, according to Igor Karkaroff. He was apparently arrested at some point afterwards, though he escaped again in the 1997 mass break-out with Stan Shunpike that was hushed up by the British Ministry of Magic as Kingsley Shacklebolt said that Travers should be in Azkaban. On 27 July, 1997 Travers participated in the Battle of the Seven Potters, pursuing Hermione Granger, who was disguised as Harry Potter, and Kingsley Shacklebolt, who cursed him, causing his hood to fall back revealing to Shacklebolt that he had broken out of prison. Before the beginning of August of the same year, Travers was convicted again for his Death Eater activities. On 1 August, 1997, the British Ministry of Magic was taken over by the Death Eaters and Pius Thicknesse (under the influence of the Imperius Curse) was made Minister for Magic. Now falsely cleared, Travers went on to work at the Ministry of Magic (at the Department of Magical Law Enforcement), as a superior to Mafalda Hopkirk."

However, after the Second Wizarding War was over, Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt temporarily relaxed the entry requirements due to the deaths of many Aurors. In order to resupply their forces immediately, Shacklebolt permitted anyone who participated in the Battle of Hogwarts on the grounds that having fought and survived in such a battle and not changing sides against such odds more than satisfied the character and skill requirements to qualify for the training. To qualify for Auror training, a witch or wizard had to first have attained at least five N.E.W.T.s of no less than 'Exceeds Expectations'. Whereas the Ministry set a series of character and aptitude tests to further test the worth of potential applicants, it was also possible for someone to be offered a job in the Auror Office if one of its high-ranking and influential members deems an individual to have displayed sufficient ability to be qualified, although they still have to undergo the required training programme in order to become a fully-fledged Auror. For those who are accepted, Auror training took three years of further study after Hogwarts. During the course of their training, they have access to a number of training rooms and in addition to getting on-the-job-training, they also have to participate in training duels and attend various lectures and seminars ministered by veterans at the Auror Office."

Two years later in 1994, Dennis also received a letter from Hogwarts, something which was very rare for a Muggle family: to bear two magically-gifted children. After receiving his surprise letter of acceptance into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Dennis was excited to finally attend Hogwarts in the 1994-1995 school year and his brother Colin Creevey was very anxious for his brother to arrive and be Sorted.

The ceremony's purpose was to assign first-years to one of the four school Houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. However, they realised that they would have to find an alternative once they had died and so Godric Gryffindor came up with the idea of the Sorting Hat, which he and the other three enchanted with their combined prowess to review and assign future generations long after they were dead, and thus the Sorting Ceremony was born. The Sorting Hat was placed upon a stool at the head of the Great Hall, whereupon it sang a song of its own composition about the four founders of Hogwarts and the qualities sought by their respective Houses (this song was different every year). The Sorting Hat also could also give warnings to the students whenever it detected a need, likely based on information learned in the Headmaster's Office, where it was kept for the remainder of the year. New students were then summoned to the stool one by one in alphabetical order by last name, where they were sat upon the stool and the hat placed on their head. The decision of the Sorting Hat was generally considered to be final, although its decision could be influenced somewhat by the desires of the wearer. When Harry Potter was being sorted in his first year, the hat told him he would do well in Slytherin, but Harry asked to be placed elsewhere."

In cases where infringement was severe, the office could dispatch Ministry representatives to take legal affair, and in the absolutely worst cases, they were allowed to immediately destroy the accused's wand, or the offender could be referred to the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement for an official disciplinary hearing to reach an official decision as to imprisonment and destruction of the accused's wand was warranted \u2014 and although high-profile cases are known to have taken place before the whole Wizengamot, this was highly unusual. A notable example on their daily work was how the Office was tasked with taking action against the activist Carlotta Pinkstone, who deliberately used magic indiscriminately in public places, in full sight of Muggles, and as a result, she was subject of a long series of convictions and imprisonments in the wizarding prison of Azkaban. Dolores Umbridge started her career as a lowly intern in this office right after leaving Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at 17 years old, and due to her tyrannical methodologies underneath her sweet attitude, along with taking credit for other people's work, she became Head of the division before 30 years old.

Its head of office was Arthur Weasley until 1996, when he was promoted to head of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office regulated the use of magic on Muggle objects and tried to keep items that had been bewitched away from Muggles. There appeared to be a law prohibiting the enchantment of a Muggle item with the intent to use it for purposes other than for what it was designed; Arthur Weasley claimed he was able to bewitch a Ford Anglia to fly legally because he did not intend to fly the car. After rescuing Harry from near-starvation by the Dursleys, Ron explained a scenario in which a deceased witch's bewitched tea-set ended up in the possession of a Muggle woman. When the woman served tea with her friends, the teapot and the sugar tongs attacked the Muggles, causing one man to end up in hospital with third-degree burns and possibly a broken nose. He also got the opportunity to analyse some dangerous books that the Ministry of Magic confiscated, including one that burned a reader's eyes out, one that forced readers to speak in limericks, and a cursed book that a viewer could not stop reading. A proposed law that seemed to have originated in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office was the Muggle Protection Act in 1992, drafted by Arthur Weasley. It is possible that, at times, there may have been minor collaboration between this division and the Portkey Office within the Department of Magical Transportation, in the unlikely event that a Muggle picked up a piece of rubbish that had been enchanted to become a Portkey.

Being the department that upholds the laws of Britain's wizarding community, all other departments, aside from the secretive Department of Mysteries, were answerable to it. Former Head Bartemius Crouch Senior utilised his powers to permit the usage of the Unforgivable Curses against the enemies, among other law changes that seem atrocious under times of peace. Former head Pius Thicknesse had a large network of connections with the heads of the other Departments, which the Death Eaters took advantage of when they worked to subjugate him, thus enabling them to easily spread their Imperius Curses into the majority of the bureaucracy. Once the personnel and/or guests stepped out of the lift, they found themselves in a corridor lined with doors on both sides, around the corner of which there were a set of heavy oak doors leading into the Auror Headquarters: a large open area divided into small cubicles, one for each Auror.

All house-elves had their own brand of powerful magic, which allowed them to perform tasks, such as Apparating, where wizards and witches couldn't. In 1993, Dobby did not hesitate to protect Harry Potter, by using his magic on his former master Lucius Malfoy to blast him away after he attempted to physically assault Harry on the Grand Staircase. However, unlike some other magical beings, the house-elf was actually quite happy not to own a wand, as they did not require one for their daily activities. Apart from routine domestic tasks, house-elves usually had to obtain permission from their master before they would use their own brand of magic for other things. It is implied that with a wand and the proper knowledge, a house-elf might be able to do other magic, as Winky was falsely accused of using the Morsmordre curse to summon the Dark Mark.

As Gareth Greengrass indeed speculated, it is very likely that Patel was deceased, as of 2018, though there was a small chance they were still alive."

  "summary": "Minister Rufus Scrimgeour (d. 1 August, 1997) was a British wizard who was a powerful ranking official in the Ministry of Magic. He originally joined the Ministry of Magic as an Auror, where he became a hardened veteran, spending most of his life fighting Dark Wizards. During the Second Wizarding War, Scrimgeour was appointed in 1996 to succeed Cornelius Fudge as Minister for Magic, being the third ex-Auror to hold the post. While he appeared to provide a much tougher and resolute stance against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters, he made the same mistake of creating the appearance of safety and security, while in truth Scrimgeour's efforts were waning in progress in the war. This policy of giving the appearance of false safety would ultimately cost Scrimgeour his life, as it left the Ministry open to infiltration by the Death Eaters, who used several high-ranking Ministry officials, all of whom had been subverted to their control, to launch a successful coup and bring the Ministry under Voldemort's control. It was highly likely Scrimgeour attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during his youth, where he would have received his magical education. Scrimgeour joined the Ministry of Magic, and completed a stringent series of character and aptitude tests to join the Auror Office. Eventually, after serving as an Auror for some time and having fought Dark Wizards for most of his working life, Scrimgeour rose to the post of Head of the Auror Office, which he occupied at least in the early-to-mid-1990s. With Voldemort finally into the open and declaring open war on Britain's wizarding and Muggle communities, it forced the wizarding community to unite and call for Cornelius Fudge's resignation."

He then joined Newton Scamander, Porpentina Goldstein, Theseus Scamander, Rudolph Spielman, Nagini, Jacob Kowalski, and Yusuf Kama at the Hogwarts Viaduct. He considered his place as the wizard in charge of the security of the British community as giving him the ability to pursue any course of action he saw fit, whether it was interrupting a Defence Against the Dark Arts class at Hogwarts while Dumbledore was still teaching (and in spite of Professor McGonagall's protests) or ordering the arrest of people for merely coming into contact with criminals like Gellert Grindelwald and his followers. Although he seemed to agree to compromise about lifting Newt Scamander's travel ban in exchange for him tracking down Credence Barebone and killing him, he refused to accept any negotiations about the terms of the deal, rejecting Newt's request as soon as he refused it. He also demanded that Dumbledore fight Grindelwald for the Ministry rather than ask, all the while ignoring the Hogwarts teacher's advice regarding his approach to dealing with the threat."

As a moderate type of dark magic, hexes were slightly worse than jinxes, but were not as dark as curses. Hexes could also be countered by using a Hex-Breaker or Hex Zapper, which both countered their effects. For instance, Ginny Weasley gained a reputation for being an accomplished caster of the Bat-Bogey Hex, particularly in 1996 after using it to free herself from Dolores Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad and also for casting it on Zacharias Smith from her carriage on the Hogwarts Express. The word \"hex\" may have been derived from Pensylvania German hexe meaning \"to practise witchcraft\" or German hexen \"to hex\", a meaning that the word still retains today when used as a verb."

Goblins wanted to go, but they weren't allowed, and the magical community of Liechtenstein protested because Bonaccord wanted to ban troll hunting and give rights to trolls. A tribe of Mountain Trolls had been causing a lot of trouble in Liechtenstein, so their wizarding community contested Bonaccord's appointment, and refused to join the Confederation as a result. In 1692, the Confederation instituted the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy to hide the wizarding world from the Muggle world. After weeks of discussion, they decided on how the wizarding world would retreat into hiding, including the covering up of various magical beasts and eliminating them from the Muggle consciousness. In 1750, the Confederation added Clause 73 to the International Statue of Wizarding Secrecy that detailed each wizarding governing body's responsibilities for concealment and possible disciplinary action for any breaches. In the eighteenth century, after Dorcus Twelvetrees revealed the locations of the MACUSA headquarters and Ilvermorny School to Bartholomew Barebone, a descendant of a Scourer, and almost exposed the wizarding world, MACUSA faced a \"humiliating\" censure by the International Confederation of Wizards. On 6 December 1926, the wizarding newspaper The New York Ghost reported that the Confederation had called an emergency meeting to address magical disturbances that were risking exposure of the wizarding world. On 7 December 1926, The New York Ghost reported that MACUSA would be working with the Confederation to \"crack down on illegal wizards\" in New York City."

This seems to no longer be the case beginning with the second film, which uses a colon instead. The plot of the first film revolves around Newton Scamander, or commonly known as Newt, a Magizoologist who arrives in New York in December of 1926, to stay for a brief time following a journey around the world to research creatures for his book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. When some of the creatures escape, the situation threatens the secrecy of the Wizarding world and the relationship between the magical and non magical societies in America, which is already in danger due to the New Salem Philanthropic Society. Newt battles to find the creatures with the help of Jacob and Porpentina \"Tina\" Goldstein before it's too late, with Percival Graves on his tail. It begins to centre around Gellert Grindelwald, who made a brief appearance in the first film and was considered the darkest Wizard of his time.

Unlike the No-Maj United States Congress, which is divided into a House of Representatives and a United States Senate, the MACUSA was unicameral. MACUSA performed many of the same functions as other wizarding governing bodies in other countries, such as the Ministries of Magic or Councils of Magic. In MACUSA\u2019s early years, its primary aim was to rid the continent of Scourers, corrupt wizards who had hunted their fellow magical beings for personal gain. MACUSA\u2019s second great law enforcement challenge was the number of wizarding criminals who had fled to America from Europe and beyond, precisely because of the lack of organised law enforcement such as existed in their own countries. The Magical Congress of the United States of America was established in 1693 with the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy, as a direct result of the Salem Witch Trials. The first task of the North American wizarding legislature was to put on trial the Scourers, a unscrupulous and brutal band of wizarding bounty hunters and racketeers, executing those convicted of murder, wizard-trafficking, and torture."

Overall, her demeanour did not suggest that she would be very helpful, as making research was very difficult in the Hogwarts library. As with a helpful librarian, students would not have to spend hours simply looking for the books they needed, but using the information that could have been found quickly in the their homework, leaving less time for studying. Before Harry Potter's time at Hogwarts, the Restricted Section had books about Horcruxes in it including Secrets of the Darkest Art. However by Tom Riddle's time at Hogwarts in the 1940s, Horcruxes were a banned subject and Albus Dumbledore was very strict about it. It's unknown when, but Dumbledore eventually removed every book containing information on Horcruxes in the library.

As the carriage set off for the journey to Europe, Spielman examined the vial with interest before noting that Grindelwald no longer had his \"silver tongue\", MACUSA having cut it out to prevent him from coaxing his guards to side with him. To Spielman's shock and horror, however, \"Grindelwald\" was subsequently revealed to be a disguised Abernathy, who had swapped places with the real Grindelwald who was at that moment attacking the carriage. Spielman's white-handled wand, as well as those of the two Aurors with him, suddenly pointed themselves at their owner's necks before disintegrating, after which Spielman caught sight of Grindelwald's face peering in. Panicking, Spielman opened the case he held, only to find an infant chupacabra within that proceeded to maul the German wizard's neck, all whilst Abernathy retrieved the vial even as Spielman and the Aurors fought to restrain him. Seeing Abernathy's wand, which Grindelwald had dropped after him, Spielman was able to grab it and cast a Slowing Charm mere seconds before he impacted the water (it is possible that Grindelwald let him survive so he could tell the tale about his spectacular escape because right before Spielman was able to grab the wand, Grindelwald made a grabbing motion with his hand, which could've been some wandless charm, since Grindelwald is highly proficient in wandless and non-verbal magic)."

In the 1960s, he was \"Australia's star Chaser\" \u2014 in which capacity he was noted to have endured many jinxes, something that fuelled his dislike of spectator crowds later in his life. In 1971, Royston Idlewind was named International Director of the International Confederation of Wizards Quidditch Committee. Upon his contentious appointment, he immediately issued the statement that the only thing he disliked about Quidditch was the crowds, thus gaining the wizarding world's dislike and distrust \u2014 this petty dislike soon turned into outright hostility when Idlewind passed a number of draconian regulations on crowd control, the worst of which was the ban of all wands from the stadium except those carried by ICWQC officials. Many fans threatened to boycott the 1974 Quidditch World Cup in protest, but seeing as empty stands were Idlewind's secret ambition, their strategy was not effective. The World Cup duly commenced and the crowds that attended carried with them not their wands, but a new style of musical instrument called a Dissimulator: a tube-like object that issued bright lights and colourful puffs of smoke in national colours and emitted loud cheers for the teams being supported. When Royston Idlewind appeared in the Top Box, a hundred thousand Dissimulators emitted loud raspberries turned back instantly into the wands they had been concealing all along."

During the 1988\u20131989 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, fifth year Charms class students were taught about this charm by Professor Filius Flitwick for the Ordinary Wizarding Levels in the subject. In December 1997, Hermione Granger suggested using a Disillusionment Charm when she and Harry Potter were planning the visit to Godric's Hollow. It seemed that if one was using the charm on themselves, they must have twirled their wand around themselves as though they were wrapping themselves in rope.

I have written to the Minister for Magic and am expecting him to give Stubby, alias Sirius, a full pardon any day now.\" Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic, denied that he had any plans to take over the running of the Wizarding Bank, Gringotts, when he was elected Minister for Magic five years ago."

  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Celestina_Warbeck",
  "summary": "Celestina Warbeck was born on 18 August, 1917 in Wales to a wizard father and a Muggle mother. Her father, a minor functionary in the Muggle Liaison Office, met her mother, a failed actress, when the latter was attacked by a Lethifold disguised as a stage curtain. Celestina's musical talent was apparent even at an early age; in 1927, the wizarding magazine Spellbound published an article about her talents when she was around ten years old, referring her as a child prodigy. Disappointed to learn that there was no such thing as a wizarding stage school, Mrs Warbeck reluctantly let her daughter go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (which she attended from 1928-1936 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House), but frequently bombarded the school with letters to form a theatre club, choir and dancing class to showcase her daughter's innumerable talents. Frequently appearing with a chorus of backing banshees, Celestina's concerts were justly famous. Her tickets often went on sale in the black market for vastly inflated prices (one reason why Molly Weasley, who listened to her songs every Christmas, could never see her favourite singer live)."

  "summary": "The Tongue-Tying Curse (Mimblewimble), also known as the Tongue-Tying Spell, was a curse that tied the target's tongue in a knot, preventing them from making coherent speech. This feature also allowed one to prevent the victim from speaking the incantations of spells correctly, and hence like the Silencing Charm it was useful in duelling (though can be overcome with more advanced magic). During the 1988\u20131989 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Patricia Rakepick taught this curse to her fifth year Defence Against the Dark Arts students. In 1989, Bill Weasley willingly allowed Jacob's sibling to cast this spell on him in an effort to amuse Peeves the poltergeist and get him to disclose the whereabouts of the Weasley twins. On 31 July 1994, when Rubeus Hagrid found out that Harry Potter had been told nothing of the wizarding world, he angrily rounded on the Dursleys, at which point Harry heard his Uncle Vernon whisper \"something that sounded like 'Mimblewimble'\", although since Vernon was a Muggle and had no knowledge of magic, his utterance of such a word was ironic in the sense that it was an incantation for a spell. It was placed to prevent Severus Snape from revealing the area's location to Lord Voldemort, as the properties of the Fidelius Charm protecting the house made Snape a Secret-Keeper when Albus Dumbledore died. It is unknown what would occur if Snape tried to write the location on paper, which would also have passed on the secret of the house's location. Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger were affected by this curse when they sought refuge at 12 Grimmauld Place after fleeing Death Eaters in 1997."

In 1899, it was mentioned that the Dark Wizard, Gellert Grindelwald, sought to create an army of Inferi, and believed that the Resurrection Stone could grant him such powers. It is unknown as to whether he succeeded, though his conception of the stone's abilities was in fact incorrect, as it brings back souls from the realm of the dead as more-than-ghost but less-than-alive state, not as a living body. During the First Wizarding War, Voldemort was known to have created an army of Inferi from the large number of people he murdered. The Inferi in question were mostly vagrant, homeless Muggles murdered by Voldemort, but some of them were the earthly remains of wizards and witches who 'disappeared' during the war without explanation. This could possibly include wizards from the Ministry, members of the Order that were never found, or just random unlucky witches and wizards. In 1979, when Regulus Black attempted to destroy the said Horcrux, he succumbed to the Drink of Despair's effects and tried to take a drink of water from the lake, only to trigger the Inferi and was killed by them. The Ministry warned the community that Lord Voldemort may be using Inferi once again in the Second Wizarding War, and it was mentioned that he did use Inferi during the First War."

During their childhood, their parents taught Jacob and his sibling that they could not go around flaunting their magic. In particular, their mother was strict about the use of magic outside of school, refusing both of her children to ride a broomstick before they began attending school. At some point in his childhood, Jacob convinced his younger sibling to steal Sickles from their mother's coat pockets. At age eleven, Jacob visited Ollivander's in Diagon Alley, and caused Mr Olivander's favourite inkpot to explode when trying out wands. At some point during his school career, Jacob embarked on a foolhardy quest to uncover the secrets of the fabled Cursed Vaults, presumably in order to get his hands on the gold, prophecies and various other powerful magical artefacts, myth would have it, had been sealed within them. In Jacob's case, however, his reputation as one of the most talented and rebellious students of his time at school gave credence to his search. As such, the Headmaster Albus Dumbledore took a personal interest in Jacob, and even helped nurture his gift after discovering that Jacob was a born Legilimens. As time passed, however, Dumbledore noticed Jacob had become increasingly obsessive in his search for the vaults and changed because of it."

The General Counter-Spell terminated all spell effects ranging from simple dark charms, although it would probably be ineffective against moderate to major dark charms; though it was effective when cast by multiple people at once, capable of ending the effects of the extremely destructive Protego Diabolica. In 1927, a group casting by Nicolas Flamel, Newt Scamander, Theseus Scamander, Tina Goldstein, and Yusuf Kama countered Gellert Grindelwald's powerful Protego Diabolica that the Dark Wizard used in an attempt to destroy Paris. During the 1986\u20131987 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Filius Flitwick taught his third year students in Charms class how to cast this spell. That same year, when Jacob's sibling consulted him about a cursed bludger, Flitwick determined that the curse, though nasty, could be undone with the spell, which the student performed successfully.

  "summary": "Rappaport's Law was an American wizarding law enacted by President Emily Rappaport in 1790 in response to the fallout of Dorcus Twelvetrees's breach of the International Statute of Secrecy. It banned witches and wizards from marrying or befriending No-Majs, allowing only interactions \"necessary to perform daily activities\", and meted out \"harsh\" penalties for fraternisation with No-Majs. To ensure complete conformity with the Law, only upon reaching the age of majority (seventeen) would a witch or wizard be legally allowed to carry a wand outside school: wands were issued when students first arrived at Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and had to be left at school during vacations. Rappaport's Law had the long-term consequence of driving the American wizarding community even deeper underground and widening the cultural divide between the wizarding communities of the United States and Europe. In Europe, wizarding governments clandestinely cooperated and communicated with their Muggle counterparts, and witches and wizards were free to marry and befriend Muggles. However, in the United States, the Magical Congress of the United States of America exercised complete independence from the No-Maj government, and wizards and witches increasingly came to view the country's No-Maj population with hostility. The law also required all wizards in America to apply for and carry a wand permit, so as to keep track of magical activity and keep track of wizards who use magic against the limits set by the law. The 1920 book Spell Casting in the Age of Rappaport's Law by Yuri Von Blisch examined the impact of Rappaport's Law on the use of magic in the United States. In 1926, Queenie Goldstein met No-maj Jacob Kowalski when the pair, and Queenie's sister Tina, became involved with Magizoologist Newt Scamander's search the magical creatures that escaped from his suitcase. By 1927, they had discussed marriage but were unable to wed due to Rappaport's Law."

Gore successfully put down a number of revolts by the magical beings, although historians feel his refusal to contemplate rehabilitation programmes for werewolves ultimately led to more attacks. One such revolt took place in 1762, in which goblin rebel Vargot was killed in battle \u2014 a popular historical theory that may have not been proved is that Vargot was really a renegade house-elf. In 1754, Minister Gore and the Italian Minister for Magic officiated the infamous broom race from Aberdeen to Rome between the two most famous fliers in Europe, Torquil McTavish and Silvio Astolfi. Orabella Nuttley, a clerk of the Improper Use of Magic Office, who had been assigned to handle luggage and arrange Portkeys, stepped forward and repaired a few columns with the Mending Charm she had invented. Amazed, Gore and the other assembled Ministers asked her to teach them how to perform it, and the damage to the Coliseum was undone by the time the Muggles that woke up to the sound of the explosion arrived at the scene.

Experts argued that if the Dementors were deprived of prisoners' souls on which they could feed, they might abandon the prison and head for the mainland.

After Moody was freed and regained his eye, the eye tended to get stuck in mid-rotations at times, due to Barty Crouch Jnr having worn it."

In 1926, Newton Scamander travelled to New York, while returning from a year long trip to research magical creatures that led to his authorship of wizarding bestseller Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, in 1927. An anti-witchcraft organisation called the New Salem Philanthropic Society held rallies in 1920s New York City, led by charismatic leader Mary Lou Barebone and her three adopted children. Newt told Tina Goldstein that he came to New York to buy a rare Appaloosa Puffskein as a present for someone, but in reality he meant to travel on to the desert of Arizona to release his Thunderbird, which he rescued from captivity in Egypt. At the same time, an Obscurial caused havoc around New York, committing murder and tearing up buildings and streets. During October of 1926, No-maj brooms were seeing a record breaking of sales, The New York Ghost saw this as a questionable investiment oppurtunity. The wizarding community entered in The New York Ghost, wondering if No-Maj literature was worth reading. The fa\u00e7ade of Steen National Bank pictured on the picture to the left of this paragraph seems to have been based on the that of the Appellate Division Courthouse of New York State, opposite Madison Square Park, in Manhattan, with minor differences (namely, the design of the doors, the length of the staircase, and the absence of the two statues flanking the stairs which are here replaced with elaborate streetlamps)."

For her achievements of inventing of many love potions, she was immortalised on a Chocolate Frog Card. Albus Dumbledore believed that Merope Gaunt used a love potion to obtain the affections of Tom Riddle Snr, a wealthy Muggle who lived in her village and whom she was infatuated with, as it would seem to be a more romantic method of obtaining his \"love\" than the also possible method of the Imperius Curse. Love potions were banned at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry but this has not stopped students from making them, or from trying to win hearts by their use. In the 1988\u20131989 school year, Ismelda Murk planned on giving Barnaby Lee a love potion hidden in a sandwich. Indeed, love potions were usually hidden in food or drinks so that the user would not notice. On Valentine's Day, 1992, Gilderoy Lockhart implored his co-workers at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to join him in celebrating the occasion, suggesting that students should ask Professor Snape how to brew a love potion."

Cauldrons were once used by Muggles and wizards and witches alike, being large metal cooking pots that could be suspended over fires. In time, magical and non-magical people alike moved on to stoves; saucepans became more convenient and cauldrons became the sole province of witches and wizards, who continued to brew potions in them. A naked flame was essential for the making of potions, which made cauldrons the most practical pot of all. While cauldrons remained classic potion-making utensils, there were attempts to revolutionise the cauldron, like the invention of the Self-Stirring Cauldron by Gaspard Shingleton, or the Collapsible Cauldron. All cauldrons were enchanted to make them lighter to carry, as they were most commonly made of pewter or iron. Modern inventions included the self-stirring and collapsible varieties of cauldron, and pots of precious metal were also available for the specialist, or the show-off. As one of his first assignments with the Ministry of Magic, Percy Weasley worked with the Department of International Magical Co-operation lobbying for a standard for cauldron thickness. Apparently, there was an issue with sub-standard imported cauldrons having defective, thin bottoms."

Nonetheless, due to her phenomenal success, many of her rivals began to suspect that she was privy to a secret which they were not. A rival Muggle tailor, Snickerton, donned a disguise and applied for a job in Madam Crimp's shop. However, after several weeks, the only evidence of magic he had uncovered was the lack of scissors in her workroom. He saw Crimp cutting out an intricate pattern with her wand, and the next day, he brought a group of men to arrest her. Taken by surprise at her shop, Madam Crimp could offer no explanation as to why she had no scissors. Snickerton ordered her bound, fearing she might curse them, and began searching her shop for a wand. Finally, Crimp asked to be untied so that she might scratch her chin, on which she had a large wart.

Those suffering from insanity often cannot interact with normal society, and frequently require long-term treatment in a medical facility such as St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. Prolonged exposure to certain curses, such as the Cruciatus Curse or the Imperius Curse, may cause this condition. It can also be inflicted by certain types of potions, either temporarily or permanently, such as the Drink of Despair and possibly Essence of Insanity. In 1991, as Vernon Dursley wildly drove the Dursley family and Harry Potter to various locations in the hope of shaking off following wizards, Dudley Dursley ventured the suggestion that he had gone mad. In his earlier years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Ronald Weasley, particularly in the early stages of their association, often claimed that Hermione Granger was insane because she was clever, read excessively and for pleasure, and retained information which was never of adequate interest for him to notice. Starting in the summer of 1995, the Daily Prophet, under pressure from the British Ministry of Magic, ran a smear campaign claiming, among other things, that Harry Potter's assertion that Lord Voldemort had returned was a sign that he had gone insane, which only ended when Voldemort's return was proven following the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Albus Dumbledore, who was also a prime factor in an attempt to spread Harry's claim, was also considered insane for the duration. When Harry gave an interview to Rita Skeeter regarding these events on Valentine's Day 1996, he wondered how people would react to it, suspecting that for many people it would simply confirm that he was completely insane, \"not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish about Crumple-Horned Snorkacks.\" Insanity commonly affect one's perception on reality, making them believe in things that do not exist."

Although the British Ministry of Magic had no records of the their existence as of November 2020, it was implied by one of its most respected members that the organisation began as a ancient cult of Dark wizards and witches that, according to legend, could transfer knowledge and power from generation to generation through ominous-looking masks. When Lord Voldemort became active in the wizarding word during the 1960s, The Unforgivable, or at least some of its members native to the British Isles, was already pursuing power through forbidden practices and realised that their goals aligned with those of the Dark Lord and allied themselves with his cause. At some point between the unsolved murder of the world-renowned Maud Ashborn in 2002 and the early 2010s, the current incarnation of The Unforgivable discovered that an Unspeakable at the Ministry of Magic, Gareth Greengrass, was in desperate search for a cure for his daughter's ailment,  and successfully recruited him into their ranks by dangling the promise of helping him with said undertaking. After Penelope Fawley, an Auror at the Ministry of Magic, began closing in on the mysterious cabal in 2015 after she found a connection between several apparently unrelated cases she had been working on and confronted Greengrass about his involvement in several illicit activities that linked them together, The Unforgivable ordered Greengrass to cover his tracks. In compliance to their demands, he abducted her, as well as another Auror, the Ministry's Records Officer, the Head of the Department of Magical Artefacts, and a reporter from the Daily Prophet whom she had involved in her efforts to expose them, with the five victims going missing within a few hours of one another. Gareth Greengrass, who would later be revealed as the one who targeted Penelope, manipulated Grim towards an ancient spell which, when cast, caused the Calamity and possibly Grim's own disappearance."

During the Second Wizarding War, Avery fought at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries with a group of Death Eaters, attempting to take a prophecy from Harry Potter. Avery was also a friend of Severus Snape, something that bothered Lily Evans, who was Snape's best friend at the time. According to Sirius Black, Avery was part of a \"gang of Slytherins\" who later become Death Eaters and also included Bellatrix Black, her future husband Rodolphus Lestrange, Evan Rosier, Snape, and Wilkes. Sometime during the First Wizarding War, Avery was apprehended by Ministry of Magic officials and stood trial for being a Death Eater. Avery was the first Death Eater to crack and grovel at Lord Voldemort's feet during his rebirth at the cemetery, saying that he did not look for Voldemort after his downfall because he believed him to be \"finished\"."

  "summary": "The Werewolf Capture Unit was a part of the Beast Division of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, tasked with the capture of any werewolves deemed to be a threat. On a case-by-case basis, the Unit had to determine if the werewolf in question could, once returned to human form, be released back into society (as in the event of an otherwise well-meaning wizard losing control during a full moon), or if they were \"too far gone\" in the sense that they were attacking people intentionally (such as Fenrir Greyback and his followers), in which case it was implied that they might be disposed of. According to Cecil Lee, hunting werewolves was a very dangerous line of work, with many of the unit's members ending up bitten, eaten or lost in the woods or in towns while in process of hunting them down. Members of the Werewolf Capture Unit were capable of detecting if werewolves had been present in an area, being able to recognise a certain distinct smell that they left behind, distinguish werewolf saliva by its appearance and texture and recognise werewolf hair with a glance. When they searched for clues of werewolf activity, they would look for 'werewolf bits and bobs', such as pieces of their fur, fangs, as well as look for paw prints and claw marks. While the Werewolf Capture Unit members were adequate at capturing werewolves, they were not very good at holding them; as a result, werewolf escapes from the Werewolf Capture Unit were commonplace. The Werewolf Capture Unit uniform comprised a purple tailcoat with two rows of decorative polished silver buttons, a matching custodian helmet, and white gauntlet gloves."

Squibs were rare, even just one being born into a family. Squibs were incapable of practising magic in any way, as Argus Filch found out when he attempted to use the supplementary course Kwikspell, which was designed to help adult wizards improve inadequate magical skills, to no effect as he had no magical skills to improve upon. In the 1600s, Isolt Sayre, the famous founder of Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, gave birth to a daughter whom she named Martha. Martha was named after her paternal grandmother and while her twin sister Rionach was magical, Martha was not.

Flying was also used in magical sporting events, such as the popular game of Quidditch. Though broomsticks were the primary method of magical transportation in Britain, other enchanted objects were used elsewhere in the wizarding world. In Asia and the Middle East, flying carpets were the primary form of wizarding transport, but were currently designated as muggle artefacts in Britain and were therefore illegal to enchant. Vehicles such as cars and motorcycles could also be modified to be capable of flight, though this was also technically illegal under Misuse of Muggle Artefacts laws. In defiance of magical law (that stated that a wizard could only fly using a vehicle, which itself could only have a flying charm) however it was known that a few wizards or witches had achieved this feat, the most infamous being Dark Wizard Lord Voldemort who managed to achieve a way to fly without any form of magical vehicle (though some form of magical assistance was certainly required to do this)."

She was also known to place odd jinxes and hexes on library books for their protection; for instance, one copy of Theories of Transubstantial Transfiguration, on top of the usual library book spells, was jinxed to hit the reader around the head, should he ever doodle on it. Pince cleaned the dust on the shelves of the library manually, with a feather duster she brandished at students whenever they looked suspicious. At some point, the Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, visited the library with the goal of publishing Quidditch Through the Ages for Muggles to raise money. However, Madam Pince was extremely reluctant to let the book leave the confines of the library, as well as the wizarding world, and Dumbledore had to pry each of her fingers from the spine to take it. During the Teacher Appreciation Celebration, Madam Pince showed little patience while being interviewed by the Slytherin student Ismelda Murk. During this school year, Madam Pince was entrusted by Albus Dumbledore to organise the Valentine's Day Ball."

In 1995, while at the Ministry of Magic for his hearing, he noticed an Auror dictating a report to his quill. Albus Dumbledore had a \"handsome scarlet quill\" on the desk in his office; since it matched the colour of Fawkes' body feathers, it might have been a phoenix-feather quill. There was a great variety of quills, some plain and simple, some (like Fwooper quills) more fancy-looking, others enhanced with magical properties. Numerous types of feathers were used including pheasant, eagle, peacock (Gilderoy Lockhart's favourite), and perhaps phoenix."

Hermione first had to get the cloak out for use when she, Ron and Harry escaped the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour. The main use of the cloak for the three, however, was to conceal them as they Apparate and Disapparate from one place to another in search of the remaining Horcruxes that Dumbledore asked them to destroy shortly before his death.

  "summary": "Apparition was a magical form of transportation, in which the user travelled instantly from one location to another, without traversing the space in-between. The ability to Apparate was a relatively advanced skill for wizards, but other magical creatures were capable of disappearing and reappearing of their own volition as well, such as House-elves and Diricawls. Apparition was a popular method of travel in the wizarding world, though it was stated that plenty of adult witches and wizards did not bother with it, preferring broomsticks, the Floo Network, or portkeys. According to Wilkie Twycross, Ministry of Magic official and Apparition Instructor, one had to recall The Three Ds: Destination, Determination and Deliberation. A witch or wizard ordinarily required a wand in order to Apparate, but like many other spells, it could be performed without one. This type of transportation could cause an audible noise, ranging from a small pop, to a loud crack that may sound to Muggles like a car backfiring, depending on their skill. House-elves could also Apparate, but without some of the restrictions that wizards had, due to their unique type of magic. For example, they could Apparate inside Hogwarts and even the Crystal Cave, where powerful enchantments prevented witches and wizards from doing so. Apparition was called Disapparition from the point of view of someone at the place being left, and Apparition from the point of view of someone at the destination, much like the words \"disappear\" and \"appear\"."

Bill's younger brother Ron came to stay at Shell Cottage shortly after deserting Harry Potter and Hermione Granger during their mission to destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes in the autumn of that year. Although he disapproved of his brother's actions, Bill did not give him a hard time about it seeing that he regretted his actions, even deciding not to go to the Burrow for Christmas so as not to expose Ron's actions to the rest of their family. Around Easter in 1998, Ron, Harry, and Hermione were captured by Snatchers and brought to Malfoy Manor, Death Eater headquarters. This exposed Ron's cover that he had been ill at home with spattergroit, making it too dangerous for the rest of his family to go to their respective jobs. They used the Fidelius Charm to conceal their locations, and Bill was the Secret-Keeper for Shell Cottage.

Regardless, either because she did not retire or because she was pulled out of retirement, Madam Pomfrey was working at Hogwarts in 2020. Madam Pomfrey began her career at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry sometime before 1971, being trusted in that year by Headmaster Albus Dumbledore to escort new Gryffindor student Remus Lupin, who was infected with lycanthropy due to a bite from Fenrir Greyback, to the Whomping Willow every full moon. At some point before 1 November, 1981, Madam Pomfrey complimented Dumbledore on a set of earmuffs he had recently acquired. In addition to treating Ben Copper, Rowan Khanna, and Bill Weasley, all of whom at various times throughout the year was injured by the cursed ice spreading throughout the castle, an assortment of injuries caused by Quidditch, duelling, classroom accidents and general clumsiness kept Poppy very busy, including a student who was transfigured into a teapot. The same year, she enlisted Jacob's sibling to be her assistant, impressed with their bedside manner when their friend Ben was injured. One of the things she tasked said assistant with was researching sleepwalking, and teaching them to fix relatively minor injuries in a heartbeat.

His surname lived on to the 1990s, in the person of Florean Fortescue, his direct descendant, who ran Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour in Diagon Alley. Shortly after Arthur Weasley was attacked by Nagini at the Department of Mysteries, in 1995, Professor Albus Dumbledore attempted to wake up the portrait of Phineas Nigellus Black, to tell Sirius Black that Harry Potter and the Weasley children were going to 12 Grimmauld Place. As Phineas expressed unwillingness to help, the portrait of Dexter Fortescue was particularly vocal, as was Armando Dippet and a portrait of an unidentified female Head. In 1995, he roared his disapproval at Cornelius Fudge and Dolores Umbridge when the latter explained to the former how she had learned of the first meeting of Dumbledore's Army in the Hog's Head. Minerva McGonagall, also present, commented that she had wondered how Willy had gotten off so lightly after all those regurgitating toilets, and Fortescue erupted, saying that they did not cut deals with petty criminals in his day. When Harry Potter went to the Headmaster's office, shortly after Lord Voldemort's defeat and the end of the Second Wizarding War, Fortescue joined the ovation made by the previous Hogwarts Headmaster, waving him his ear trumpet. Fortescue believed in honour and duty, reprimanding Phineas Nigellus for \"dereliction of duty\" and bellowing at Cornelius Fudge, Dolores Umbridge, John Dawlish, and Kingsley Shacklebolt for cutting deals with petty criminals. In life, he was hard of hearing, necessitating the use of an ear trumpet before his death, a trait passed along to his portrait self who is seen using it to listen to private conversations in the Headmaster's office and speaking loudly when addressing observers or other portraits."

 "curse": {

  "summary": "The most heinous of the three dark charms, curses came in many strengths and forms, but were usually reserved for causing immense suffering to the victim, such as excruciating pain, total control, or even death. A curse was classified as a Dark charm, which was primarily defined as any spell that affected the object in a negative manner, typically associated with varying levels of discomfort. While curses came in many strengths and forms, they were generally the most wicked, strongest, longest-lasting, and least reversible of the Dark charms. The Unforgivable Curses were the strongest known Dark charms in existence, as their effects were very powerful and their use required skill. Blood maledictions were a specific type of curse that might not kill the target but could remain within the victim's body, and be passed down as a genetic defect that could resurface generations later. Astoria Malfoy suffered from such as curse, as her ancestor passed down a malediction that showed up in her, causing Astoria's body to be frail, and childbirth was what weakened her to the point of death a few years later. Curses were said to be rather difficult spells to master, as first year students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry were not considered by adult wizards and witches to be experienced or knowledgeable enough to cast such powerful dark spells. Like jinxes, Hogwarts students studying Defence Against the Dark Arts only learnt a few minor curses in a defensive manner, such as for duelling and defence against dark creatures, but especially learnt how to deal with them using defensive magic. The two most notable exceptions to this were the Killing Curse and the Cruciatus Curse, two of the Unforgivable Curses, which could only be dodged, intercepted or blocked with physical objects."

  "summary": "The seize and pull charm, also known as the Carpe Retractum Spell (Carpe Retractum), was a charm that produced a magical, retractable cord of light, that could be used to pull objects towards the caster, or, if the target was fixed in place, to pull the caster towards the target. In order to successfully connect the charm, the target must be in direct line of sight of the caster, as well as being relatively nearby. Once connected, the caster could pull on the rope with their wand, quickly retracting it. If the target was immovable, then the retracting rope would swiftly drag the caster towards the object. While the charm was generally used on inanimate objects, it could also be used on living things such as Bubotubers and Erklings. Although the charm was easy enough to cast, it tooks a fair amount of force to pull heavy objects or to hold on to the wand while being dragged through the air. Third-year witches and wizards were taught this spell throughout the 1993\u20131994 school year in Charms class by Professor Filius Flitwick, as well as in Defence Against the Dark Arts by Professor Remus Lupin."

  "summary": "The Hogwarts founders, also known as the Hogwarts Four, were four witches and wizards who established Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the medieval era, in the 10th century. These four founders are widely described as being the most brilliant witches and wizards of the time and were the following: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. Each of them created their own House: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin respectively. A fair man, he believed that any child who displayed magical abilities before their 11th birthday should be able to attend Hogwarts. Godric valued courage and bravery, believing these were the two most virtuous abilities a person can possess. Gryffindor was the original owner of the Sorting Hat, which he and his fellow founders enchanted to select people to be sorted into their houses, by seeing the qualities each founder valued the most. The sword became an important item a thousand years later, and was instrumental in defending Hogwarts from Slytherin's descendant. A kind and warm woman, she believed that, in order to be sorted into Hufflepuff house, a person must possess the values of loyalty, patience, and be hard-working above all else."

Lyall married Muggle Hope Howell and had one son, Remus John Lupin, who was bitten by the werewolf Fenrir Greyback in retaliation for a negative comment about lycanthropes that Lyall made. By the age of thirty, Lyall had become a world-renowned expert on Non-Human\u00a0Spiritous Apparition, which included poltergeists and Boggarts. Lyall went on an expedition to a remote Welsh woodland to investigate reports of a very fierce Boggart, and heard a woman scream. He rushed to her aid and banished the Boggart, turning it into a field mushroom with a wave of his wand. The woman was Hope Howell, a Muggle who worked for an insurance company in Cardiff. He tried to explain it was a Boggart, but she didn't understand so he acted like she had been confronted by a big and scary man. A few months later, he admitted to Hope that the Boggart had not posed any serious danger to her. This admission did not negatively impact her opinion of him, however \u2014 by this time the pair had fallen in love. Eventually, Lyall gathered the courage to propose and Hope accepted, enthusiastically committing herself to planning their nuptials."

He continued to teach Harry Potter and his class for three further years, until most, if not every one of his students dropped History of Magic after completing their Ordinary Wizarding Levels. Cuthbert came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and applied for the post of Professor of History of Magic, which he was granted. Cuthbert - now known as Professor Binns - was given Classroom 4F on the first floor near a mossy courtyard to teach in, as well as an office in the fifth-floor corridor. His lessons were known to be the most boring in all of Hogwarts; he read from his never-ending collection of notes, and his students, whom he never paid any attention to, would fall asleep listening to his droning, reedy voice, eventually waking up to copy down a name or date, but falling asleep again. Professor Binns was still teaching well into his elderly years at Hogwarts, still lecturing students in History of Magic."

 "badger": {

  "summary": "A badger is a omnivorous mammal of the Mustelidae family, distinguishable by the white stripe that runs down its snout. Like the house it represents, the badger is often underestimated and deemed non-threatening because it is not generally aggressive unless provoked, at which point it can and will viciously fight off threats even larger than itself. This symbolism was perhaps showcased best in the Battle of Hogwarts, where many Hufflepuffs stayed to fight and defend their school, with only Gryffindor outnumbering them. Uric the Oddball once turned up for a presentation before the Wizards' Council wearing nothing but a toupee that turned out to be a dead badger, after listening to a Fwooper's song continuously for three months. In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, a badger is sitting in Rubeus Hagrid's hut and reading the Daily Prophet when the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures arrives."

During the Early Middle Ages many famous wizards and witches (such as Merlin, the Peverell brothers and the founders of Hogwarts) very likely used runes to write in Old English. As such, runes were widely used by both the Early Medieval magical community as well as the Muggle community in Great Britain. Many texts in Old English were completely written using runes, for example, Albus Dumbledore's old version of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, requiring translation before mass-production for the general public. There also was a magical rune of Alastor Moody's on the file in Umbridge's office in 1998, it is possible that these features were of particular importance, and served as a form of identification or a social security number."

  "summary": "Muggle money was a wizarding term used to refer to the currency used by non-magic people, with varying types depending on nationality. It couldn't be used in the wizarding world because wizards and witches had their own currency, which in Great Britain consisted of galleons, sickles and knuts. However, Muggle money could be exchanged with the wizarding community at locations such as Gringotts Wizarding Bank in order for Muggle-borns to acquire such funds. Muggle money exchanged at Gringotts was put back into circulation in the Muggle world by goblins, so as to make sure the\u00a0wizarding world\u00a0was hidden from\u00a0Muggles. Wizardkind who were unfamiliar with the Muggle world might have difficulty dealing with Muggle currency, to the point of trying to use incompatible wizarding currency instead. At some point between 1855 and 1858, the British Minister for Magic Priscilla Dupont transformed the coins in the pocket of the Muggle Prime Minister Lord Palmerston into frogspawn, to her irrational loathing of him. In 1992, when Mr and Mrs Granger were in Diagon Alley to buy school supplies with their daughter, they exchanged their money for wizarding currency at Gringotts. Later, Harry told Ron that the Dursleys hadn't given him pocket money in about six years. Later that year, at the Quidditch World Cup, Arthur and some other wizards had trouble dealing with muggle currency with the campsite owner, Mr Roberts, and one even tried to give a galleon instead. Arthur had trouble dealing with Muggle currency once again, and Harry handled the transaction with the tickets."

On 6 December 1926, Jacob Kowalski found an occamy egg on the bench next to him, inadvertently dropped by Newt Scamander. Later, Newt showed Jacob a nest of Occamies newly hatched from their eggs, including the one hatched from the egg he found, which Jacob was allowed to hold. Newt would later anonymously give Jacob a case of Occamy egg shells to use as bank collateral so that he could open his bakery. Jacob's sibling, Charlie Weasley, and Liz Tuttle planned to use Squawk's instinctive protectiveness to lure her out of hiding. However, due the the rarity and expense of true Occmay eggs, they used silver painted Ostrich eggs as a substitute.

After his death at the hands of Severus Snape during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, the mission fell to Harry Potter to complete. He was joined by Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, and they set off in the aftermath of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding. Obsessed with immortality from a young age, Lord Voldemort created a series of Horcruxes in an effort to prevent his death. Tom Riddle created his first Horcrux around the age of 16, and this became known as Tom Riddle's Diary. He used the death of a Muggle-born student named Myrtle Warren to create it, whom he had killed with Slytherin's basilisk, while she was in the girls lavatory. The following school year, Tom asked Horace Slughorn, his Potions professor, about Horcruxes and learned that it was indeed possible to create more than one. Over the ensuing years using the murders of Muggles and wizards alike, he created four more Horcruxes. These were Marvolo Gaunt's Ring, Slytherin's Locket, Hufflepuff's Cup, and Ravenclaw's Diadem. He believed seven to be a magically powerful number and wished to create a seven part soul, but he seemed to save the creation of Horcruxes for murders he considered significant. As of Hallowe'en 1981, he had a six part soul with five finished Horcruxes, but the process had rendered his remaining soul very unstable."

  "summary": "Although the exact definition of a counter-spell is unclear, it can be assumed from the name, that counter-spells countered the spell type that replaces the \"-spell\" suffix in their name (if it did so). Whilst this would suggest that counter-curse referred to a counter-spell that countered a spell of any type, this cannot be true due to the known existence of counter-jinxes. Therefore, the true counter-spell nomenclature is unknown, though (according to all canonical sources), it seems to go as such: counter-spells that acted like charms (regardless of the spell type they countered and regardless of whether they prevented or removed the spell in effect) were termed counter-charms; counter-spells that acted like Transfigurations were Untransfigurations; a counter-spell designed to foil another offensive spell was termed either a counter-jinx, -hex or -curse depending on how strong it was (similar to the offensive spell hierarchy); and counter-spells that prevented jinxes (but do not remove them) were termed anti-jinxes. For the purposes of this wiki, broad-spectrum counter-spells (such as the widely-used Finite Incantatem, which simply terminated spell effects in general) or ones that appeared to be counter-spells but are of unknown type are termed undifferentiated counter-spells."

She was covered in ash and her face was red and tear-streaked, but nonetheless she and Myron instantly fell in love with each other. Two weeks later, Albert found that the house was getting dirty and thus decided it was time for Violet to come home.

In 1976 Severus Snape and his classmates attended this potion, as in 1996 Horace Slughorn commented on the excellent job he did. In 1996 Harry Potter's attempt at brewing this potion went rather well, as at the time he had the assistance of the Half-Blood Prince's copy of Advanced Potion-Making. None of his other classmates succeeded in this, which hints at the complexity and advanced nature of the potion. At some point, Gethsemane Prickle brewed a Draught of Living Death to help subdue a Mountain Troll that had escaped from Percival Shacklehorn's tent into London, England. The potion is difficult to concoct, since Hermione Granger, a very talented potion-maker, who managed to concoct Polyjuice Potion (which was in no small way a difficult potion to make) in her second year, had trouble doing it in her sixth."

A mirror behind the bar reflected the cosy atmosphere, and popular drinks such as Butterbeer and Firewhisky were served in glasses and in foaming pewter tankards, as well as gillywater, Mulled Mead, red currant rum, and even cherry syrup and soda with ice and an umbrella. The Three Broomsticks was allegedly as old as Hogsmeade itself; popular rumour suggested that the village founder, Hengist of Woodcroft, lived there during medieval times. She managed the Three Broomsticks for at least twenty years, since Harry Potter's father, James Potter, was a student at Hogwarts. According to Hermione Granger, in Sites of Historical Sorcery it was mentioned that the inn at Hogsmeade served as human headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion. At the end of this school year at Hogwarts, a Hogwarts party was held at the Three Broomsticks Inn, which was organised by students at Hogwarts in order to celebrate school life. Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger enjoyed drinking butterbeer at the inn, where they frequently encountered Rubeus Hagrid and other regulars as well. During the 1993\u20131994 school year, Harry was unable to go to Hogsmeade because of the events surrounding Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban.

It referred to a boy who would be born at the end of July in 1980, who had the power to defeat Lord Voldemort (which Voldemort took to mean Harry Potter). During the prophecy, Trelawney specified that the requirements for the boy of the prophecy who was capable of (but not necessarily would be) defeating the Dark Lord. They were the following: it was a boy, he is born in the closing days of July of 1980 (the year that the prophecy was made), his parents had defied Voldemort three times and lived to tell about it, he would have a power that Voldemort was unable or unwilling to comprehend, and if more than one person was born that met the requirements, Voldemort himself would choose to whom it would ultimately refer. Severus Snape, who at the time was working for Voldemort, was caught eavesdropping on Trelawney and Dumbledore by the owner of the Hog's Head and was subsequently thrown out of the pub. As Snape was apprehended by Aberforth Dumbledore before the full prophecy could be made, only part of the prophecy was reported to Voldemort. Voldemort learned that there were two boys that met the requirements of the prophecy: Aside from Harry Potter, the other was Neville Longbottom, who was born on 30 July, 1980, to a pair of Aurors who, like James and Lily Potter, had directly defied Voldemort on three separate occasions. He marked him with a lightning-bolt scar and did not kill him, but gave Harry powers, and a future, which would enable Harry to escape Voldemort four times, something neither Harry's parents nor Neville's parents ever achieved."

In their first year at Hogwarts, the twins set off a Dungbomb and incurred Filch's wrath.

Harry prepared the potion with the hope that, if he could persuade the professor to taste the potion, Slughorn would be in \"such a good mood that he would be prepared to hand over\" the memory about young Voldemort and his search for information about Horcruxes. To brew this potion, follow these steps:\nAs the name implies, this potion induces sudden euphoria in the drinker - excessive singing and nose-tweaking are possible side-effects (a sprig of peppermint added to the potion during preparation helps to counterbalance these)."

Different Methods of Potion Preparation\nIndeed, from antiquity until well into the Modern Ages, a physics devoid of metaphysical insight would have been as unsatisfying as a metaphysical devoid of physical manifestation. The best-known goals of the alchemists were the transmutation of common metals into Gold or Silver (less well known is plant alchemy, or \u201cSpagryic\u201d), and the creation of a \u201cpanacea,\u201d a remedy that supposedly would cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely, and the discovery of a universal solvent. The Right Use of the Ingredients\nAlchemists enjoyed prestige and support through the centuries, though not for their pursuit of those goals, nor the mystic and philosophical speculation that dominates their literature. Rather it was for their mundane contributions to the chemical industries of the day the invention of gunpowder, ore testing and refining, metalworking, production of ink, dyes, paints, and cosmetics, leather tanning, ceramics and glass manufacture, preparation of extracts & liquors, and so on It seems that the preparation of aqua vitae, the \u201cwater of life\u201d, was a fairly popular \u201cexperiment\u201d among Europeans. Potions, from antiquity until well into the Modern Age, a physics devoid of metaphysical insight would have been as unsatisfying as a metaphysics devoid of physical manifestation. For one thing, the lack of common words for chemical concepts and processes, as well as the need for secrecy, led alchemists to borrow the terms and symbols of biblical and pagan mythology, astrology, kabbalah and other mystic and esoteric fields; so that even the plainest chemical recipe ended up reading like an abstruse magic incantation."

When Death made it clear that he would not let the brothers pass across the bridge without him fulfilling each of their personal desires, the wizarding siblings decided to go along with Death's offer, but each for different motives and reasons. Death proceeded to give the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone, and the Cloak of Invisibility to each of the brothers, a collection of items that would come to be known in time as the Deathly Hallows.Secretly each of these objects was part of an elaborate scheme devised by Death to reclaim each of the brothers as his own. Indeed, as the story progressed, each of the brothers in turn lost his life at the indirect hands of his own gift (Antioch being murdered due to the lust created by the Elder Wand, and Cadmus having committed suicide upon seeing the Resurrection Stone's limitations), restoring to Death's clutches two of his victims. However, the Cloak of Invisibility enabled Ignotus to elude Death for a good many years, and finally when he had reached a ripe old age and lived a happy, long life, he took off the Cloak, gave it to his son, and departed the \"mortal coil\" with Death as an old friend, but on his own terms and not those of Death."

According to Hogwarts folklore, Professor Binns had failed to notice that he was dead: he simply got up from his chair in the staff-room one morning and left his body behind. As Professor Binns was very old at the time of his death, he was very set in his ways and students find him difficult to relate to. Binns' lessons consisted of him reciting (or \"droning\", as many would put it) lectures to his students. He did not seem to mind (or notice) that the class rarely paid attention or even slept through his class (with the exception of Hermione Granger, who alone \"seemed able to resist the soporific power of Binns' voice\"). Ron Weasley and Harry Potter both found History of Magic terribly boring, and only managed to pass the class by borrowing Hermione's notes.

There, Karkaroff did everything he could to get his school's champion (Viktor Krum) in the lead, and flew into a panic when his Dark Mark began to burn. Virtually nothing is known about Igor's early life but based on his name he was most likely born somewhere in Eastern Europe, possibly in either Russia or Bulgaria and may have attended Durmstrang Institute in his youth.

The coup was preceded by the Death Eaters using the Imperius Curse to gain servants high up in the Ministry, including Pius Thicknesse, the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. They eventually managed to get enough people in place to assassinate Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour and install Thicknesse in his place, as Voldemort's puppet. Over the course of the next year, the Ministry carried out many atrocities in line with Death Eater ideology, notably creating the Muggle-Born Registration Commission in order to imprison innocent Muggle-borns in Azkaban. After the Battle of Hogwarts on 2 May, 1998, which resulted in Voldemort's final defeat at the hands of Harry Potter and the end of the war, the Ministry was taken back and later reformed. By the time irrefutable evidence of Voldemort's return was shown, the Ministry had found themselves fallen too far back to get back on track, which was made worse when both Fudge and his successor Rufus Scrimgeour were more worried about the Ministry's reputation than actual security, such as covering up breakouts and arresting random suspects. By July, Corban Yaxley relayed information to Voldemort at the Meeting at Malfoy Manor that he had managed to place Pius Thicknesse, head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, under the Imperius Curse."

It was also ineffective against armoured opponents, such as Acromantulas and Blast-Ended Skrewts unless it happens to hit them on their underbellies, which have no protective armour. The jinx would usually simply immobilise a target, it could also be used to push or throw a target backward, or simply decrease the velocity of the victim's movement. During the 1988\u20131989 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Patricia Rakepick taught fifth year students in Defence Against the Dark Arts how to perform this jinx."

On 31 July 1992, Mrs Mason \"screamed like a banshee\" when the owl post letter warning Harry Potter about his supposed Underage magic transgression (actually committed by Dobby) was dropped on her head at 4 Privet Drive, as she suffered from ornithophobia (the fear of birds). The singer Celestina Warbeck is known to perform with a backing group of banshees, demonstrating not all Banshees are malevolent. Another possible banshee was the Bogle-banshee, mentioned by a student on the \"Second Year Essential Knowledge Test\" that Gilderoy Lockhart gave his second year Defence Against the Dark Arts class in 1992."

It was a garden pest, and in 1992, the Hogwarts Gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid explained to Harry Potter that Flesh-Eating Slugs were ruining all of the school cabbages. The Flesh-Eating Slug is apparently a fairly frightening creature to some, since a Hogwarts student was scared enough of them to turn a Boggart into one.

Cecil Lee of the Werewolf Capture Unit remarked that, for him, the spell only temporarily returned a werewolf to human form (as he believed in Lockhart's accounts, Lee assumed this was due to him having failed to fully master the charm). At some point in or shortly prior to the early 1980s, a highly accomplished and courageous Armenian warlock successfully saved the\u00a0inland city of Wagga Wagga in Australia from a fearsome and ferocious werewolf that had been terrorising its inhabitants, a feat he accomplished by means of the immensely complex Homorphus Charm. Soon thereafter, however, before the tale could reach the public eye, news of this hero's feat of bravery reached a British wizard and author by the name of Gilderoy Lockhart, who proceeded to track him down to hear the full account from the warlock for himself. Once Lockhart had convinced him to tell how he accomplished the defeat of the notorious Wagga Wagga Werewolf, however, the traveller placed a Memory Charm on him to make the warlock forget that it was he who had made the achievement in question, allowing Lockhart to take credit for said event, including it into his collection of fraudulent accounts where he alleged to have saved various villages from werewolf attacks, later known as Wanderings with Werewolves. A fan of Lockhart's, and proponent of the Homorphus Charm, he attempted to teach this spell to Jacob's sibling."

Aggressive towards witches, wizards and muggles alike, the Grindylow was only ever tamed by merpeople; the half-fish water dwellers who sometimes kept them as pets. Grindylows survived, for the most part, on fish, algae, and small sea creatures; however, occasionally they would eat humans (it is for this reason that they are classified as dark creatures). Grindylows also took to urban environments such as Porter Beach in the heart of Sheffield, where they sheltered in submerged shopping trolleys and traffic cones. The Grindylow was a sickly green colour, with green teeth and small pointy horns on its head. It had long, strong (albeit brittle) fingers which it uses to strangle its prey, and is a rather good swimmer, since it is adapted to live in water. The Grindylow had long, brittle fingers which despite their fragility were rather strong. The trick to escaping a Grindylow was to break their grip on a person; the Revulsion Jinx would help with this task, as underwater it shot jets of boiling hot water. In 1910, Newton Scamander kept a jar of baby Grindylows in water in a cupboard at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

He fought well for three years of the war, but his leg was wounded and remained very stiff even after it healed, so he left the armed forces afterwards, presumably because the wound made him incapable of fighting. By 1943, Frank returned to Little Hangleton with a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and his leg was still stiff. Despite his injury, he started working as caretaker and gardener for the elderly and snobbish squire Thomas Riddle, who lived with his wife Mary and adult son Tom in the luxurious Riddle House on a hill overlooking the village, in which he was given a small cottage on the Riddles' property.

Looking at the tub, one would imagine it would take quite some time to fill, but it actually filled remarkably fast, considering its size.

The candles were located on either end of each row, which meant that from one end, the far end of each row was lost in darkness. Some of the orbs glowed with a faint inner light, but others were cold and dark. Each glass orb that contained a record of a prophecy was labelled with the name of the person who made the prophecy, the person whom the prophecy concerned, and the year the prophecy was made. A few of these prophecies glowed a dim, \"weird,\" liquid white from within and were warm to the touch, while others remained \"dull and dark as blown light bulbs.\""

  "summary": "After Lord Voldmort's fall in 1981, then Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Barty Crouch Snr, with help of Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, rounded up a number of accused Death Eaters, including Igor Karkaroff, Ludo Bagman, Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and Rabastan Lestrange, and even Crouch's son of the same name, to be tried and sent to Azkaban. Mad-Eye captured Igor Karkaroff some time after 1981, and the Death Eater was sent to Azkaban, until Karkaroff gave up the names of a number of his fellow Death Eaters in exchange for a lighter sentence. This was news to the Ministry, but Karkaroff was sent back to Azkaban, pending a review into Rockwood's case; when Karkaroff's allegations proved true, he was released, and went on to take the position of Headmaster of Durmstrang Institute. Some time after the First Wizarding War, Ludovic \"Ludo\" Bagman was put on trial for passing information to Death Eater double-agent, Augustus Rookwood. Some time in 1981, Bellatrix, Rodolphus, and Rabastan Lestrange, and Barty Crouch Jr tortured the Aurors Frank and Alice Longbottom for information pertaining to Voldemort's location. All four were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison; due to this attack being one of the most vile acts within history, the entire court was cheering viciously on Crouch's decision. Upon hearing the sentence, Crouch Jr attempted to deny his involvement with Death Eaters, pleading for his father's mercy, to which the senior Bartemius Crouch replied, \"you're no son of mine,\" and sent him to Azkaban with the Lestranges. As they were being carted off, Bellatrix declared her unwavering loyalty to Voldemort, as well as her belief that he would return for her family and Crouch; indeed, all four Death Eaters had been freed with the Dark Lord's help by 1996, though Barty Crouch Jr had already been smuggled out of Azkaban with his father's help by 1982, and was later freed from his father's Imperius Curse by Voldemort in 1994."

  "summary": "During the 1987\u20131988 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, this spell was taught to fourth years in Charms class by Professor Filius Flitwick, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. At the start of the 1990\u20131991 school year at Hogwarts, Corey Hayden used this charm in the Hogwarts Library in front of Jacob's sibling, allowing them to get detention. Scorpius Malfoy noted that the explosions produced by this charm were rather noisy, and thus inconvenient for when trying to destroy something stealthily, such as a Time-Turner. During the Calamity in the 2010s, volunteer wizards and witches of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force heavily used the Exploding Charm in their mission to overpower Confoundables, in order to free Foundables. For example, the charm was highly useful at exploding large spheres of water which trapped British Ministry of Magic employees, and for fending off large red serpents which were guarding baby Unicorns."

 "vera verto": {

  "summary": "Animals susceptible to this spell were specifically aves, rats, and felines. Wand movement and posture were both very important for this spell, as Professor McGonagall noted when teaching her second-year class in September of 1992. To perform the spell, one must tap the targeted animal three times sharply with their wand and then point their wand directly at the animal, incanting Vera Verto. Once performed, a jet of nearly indiscernible, crystal-clear mist, almost like a spray, would shoot from the caster's wand, engulfing the animal and quickly morphing it into a goblet with a quiet whooshing noise. If performed incorrectly, a spasm of greenish light might shoot from the wand with a crackling, whining noise and the target would be transfigured incompletely. It might still be furry, or might possess a tail (or a combination of the two), and in some cases might even still emit vocal sounds. However, given that the only known case originated from Ronald Weasley's broken wand and it was on Peter Pettigrew in his Animagus rat form, it is unknown if it was an isolated occurrence. During the 1987\u20131988 school year, this spell was taught to fourth-years with rats as their targets. During the 1992\u20131993 school year, this spell was taught to second-year students, in lesson seven, as noted on her blackboard. Ronald Weasley was asked to try on his pet rat Scabbers, but his damaged wand led to an incomplete transformation."

Conjurations were distinguished from the other branches of Transfiguration, by their ability to transfigure the desired object from 'thin air', while its opposite, Vanishment, caused desired objects to disappear from existence. Since Conjuration was an advanced form of Transfiguration, most were N.E.W.T.-level, taught to sixth-years and above at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, although some conjurations were simpler and taught to younger students. Some conjurations taught included the Fire-Making Spell (Incendio), the Water-Making Spell (Aguamenti) and the Bird-Conjuring Charm (Avis), the former two of which were taught in Charms class. There were limits as to what can be conjured; Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration had five Principal Exceptions which could not be conjured, one of which was \"good food\". According to Book of Spells by Miranda Goshawk, \"for reasons that are still not fully understood ... two categories of creature are easier to conjure from nothing than any other: birds and snakes.\" If Conjuration was not performed exactly right or if the caster was simply messing around with Conjuring Spells, mistakes such as frog-rabbit hybrids could occur. Things such as severed heads and indeterminate stumps could also occur, when the conjuration wasn't exactly right, as well."

According to his nephew Barnaby, work was Cecil Lee's \"greatest passion\" (closely followed by topiary and the sculpting of his prized rose bushes); for that reason, he reportedly spent a period of more than two years without taking a single day off. When Magical Maintenance was angling for a pay raise and had the Ministry's enchanted windows display nothing but hurricanes for two months, the Werewolf Capture Unit sent Cecil to talk to them.

Linfred's descendant Harry Potter needed a dose of Skele-Gro after the bones in his right arm were broken during a Quidditch match in the 1992\u20131993 school year. Despite Harry's wishes, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart foolishly attempted to mend the bones, accidentally causing them to disappear instead. Later that school year, when Lockhart completely redecorated the Great Hall as a morale-booster for Valentine's Day, Professor Severus Snape, being one of the teachers, was disgusted by this action, and looked as though he was fed a large beaker of Skele-Gro."

In 1927, Gellert Grindelwald cast this spell in the Lestrange Mausoleum to test the loyalty of his followers and kill a number of his enemies, most of whom were Aurors trying to arrest him. Because they were loyal, Vinda Rosier, Queenie Goldstein, Abernathy, and Credence Barebone all passed through the fire into the circle. When cast, Protego Diabolica creates a protective ring of black fire around the caster. It is possible to walk through the flames unharmed, as demonstrated by Vinda Rosier, Credence Barebone, Queenie Goldstein and Abernathy amongst others, only if they are loyal to the caster and mean them no harm. Krall, who expressed doubts about Grindelwald's goals and methods earlier and thus showed an insufficient amount of loyalty towards Grindelwald, was burnt to ash within a few moments of entering the fire. Grindelwald was also seen controlling the spell as an offensive weapon by causing tendrils of black fire to extend from the ring and burn his enemies, mainly Aurors. The fire soon manifested as what appeared to be a fiery, winged demon or dragon within it as it spread and burnt everything in sight, similar to the effects of Fiendfyre. It was so powerful that it required the combined usage of the General Counter-Spell by Newt and Theseus Scamander, Tina Goldstein, Yusuf Kama and also Nicolas Flamel to properly contain and extinguish the dark fire before it destroyed the whole city of Paris. During the 1990\u20131991 school year, Professor Albus Dumbledore came to conclude that Jacob's life-threatening burns that he was being treated for at St Mungo's was Protego Diabolica, and informed Jacob's sibling about it."

During the 1992\u20131993 school year; Malfoy, now chairman of the school governors, was thrown off the Board for threatening to curse the other eleven governors' families if they did not suspend Albus Dumbledore from the position of Headmaster of Hogwarts. The following school year, Malfoy issued a complaint with the Board following an attack on his son Draco by Buckbeak the Hippogriff in a Care of Magical Creatures class, with the Governors deciding to refer to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures for a final decision on the matter. The role of the Board of Governors was unknown during the Ministry of Magic's interference in the operation of Hogwarts during the 1995\u20131996 school year, most particularly in regard to the temporary installation of Dolores Umbridge as Headmistress. It seems the Educational Decrees, passed by the Ministry, gave them the authority to override the authority of teachers, the headmaster and possibly the school governors. In 1996, the Headmaster's office did not accept Dolores Umbridge as Headmistress of Hogwarts despite the passage of Educational Decree Number Twenty-Eight by Cornelius Fudge. At the ending of the 1996\u20131997 school year, following the death of Albus Dumbledore, the professors of Hogwarts agreed that they would need to consult the governors as to whether or not Hogwarts would be allowed to reopen the following year. Any such consultation, however, was likely rendered irrelevant when the Ministry was overthrown by Voldemort's Death Eaters and again assumed direct control of the school."

After making their way past the Stone's first three defences, they encountered this obstacle in the fourth chamber. Ron took command of the black side, with himself, Harry, and Hermione replacing missing pieces, in order to defeat the obstacle and be allowed to pass. They then proceeded to play an impressive game but which was particularly brutal even by the normal standards of Wizard's Chess; by far the most lethal player was the White Queen, which personally took out at least three of the black pieces and nearly won the game in white's favour. Dumbledore probably could have just easily reversed the charm McGonagall had bewitched the chess pieces with, though, rendering them back to their original size and he most likely did so, considering how he was able to pass through quickly to reach and save Harry from Quirrell. At the end of year feast, Albus Dumbledore awarded Ron fifty house points for \"the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years\". After the Philosopher's Stone was destroyed, the undamaged pieces of the chessboard were stored in the Room of Hidden Things."

  "summary": "The flowers of the Shrivelfig grew inside the fruit, both of which were purple in colour. It was a deciduous plant, meaning that its leaves start to shed in autumn, and the plant is leafless during winter. However, due to its aggressive roots, the plant can still survive even in snowy conditions. When the fruit was skinned, which was actually the plant's flower and contained blossoms inside, it produced a purple liquid with potion-making properties. During the 1987\u20131988 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Shrivelfig was studied in fourth year Herbology class. During the lesson, Pomona Sprout shared with the class that Severus Snape loved Shrivelfigs, and Nymphadora Tonks expressed that seeing the purple plant made her wanted purple hair. In early 1993 at Hogwarts, Pomona Sprout had the second year students prune Shrivelfigs with shears during a Herbology class. When Harry Potter went to dispose of some withered stalks that he had trimmed off his Shrivelfig, he ran into Ernie Macmillan, and afterwards Ernie brought Hannah Abbott to work at the same plant as Harry and Ron Weasley. In late 1993, Severus Snape taught his third year Potions students to brew the Shrinking Solution."

  "summary": "This definition was laid down by Minister for Magic Grogan Stump in 1811, and the Being Division was formed as part of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. In the fourteenth century, Burdock Muldoon, Chief of the Wizards' Council, attempted to define Beings as any member of the magical community that walked on two legs. Muldoon invited all Beings to a summit to discuss new magical laws, and saw that his definition was unworkable. Goblins had brought with them every creature they could find with two legs, including Diricawls, Augureys, Fwoopers, Pixies, Fairies, and Trolls, and the summit descended into chaos when the Trolls started to destroy the chamber with their clubs. Muldoon's successor, Elfrida Clagg, attempted to redefine Beings as those that could speak the Human tongue. Trolls were still classed as Beings since they could be taught the Human tongue, and Jarveys were in attendance. Ghosts, who had not been classed as Beings under Muldoon since they glided, left in disgust at the Council's emphasis on matters of the living over matters of the dead. In 1811, Grogan Stump laid down the new definition of a Being, to the agreement of the magical community, along with the definition of a \"Beast\". However, the Ghosts were still sensitive to being classed as Beings since they were dead, and a new definition, \"Spirit\" was created for them. Humans (Muggles and wizards and witches) were beings, though there were extremists who campaigned for the classification of Muggles as Beasts."

 "fountain of magical brethren": {

  "summary": "The Fountain of Magical Brethren was a fountain located in the Atrium of the British Ministry of Magic that depicted the golden figures of a wizard, witch, centaur, goblin, and a house-elf. The fountain was located halfway down the hall of the Atrium, on level 8 of the Ministry. The large golden statues were located in the middle of the pool, and the tallest of them all was a wizard with a wand pointing straight into the air. Jets of water came from the ends of the two wands, the centaur's arrow, the tip of the goblin's hat, and each of the house-elf's ears. The witch and wizard were the two focal points of the fountain, with the other, \"lower\" beings looking up in \"awe and adoration\". This was very unrealistic, as centaurs and goblins considered themselves superior to wizards and witches. The fountain supposedly represented harmony in the wizarding world, although Albus Dumbledore thought otherwise, saying that wizards and witches had mistreated and abused their fellows for a long time and they were now reaping what they'd sown. As Harry Potter entered the Ministry in 1995 to attend his hearing for inadvertently breaching the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, he saw the fountain and the sign for all the proceedings: he mentally noted that if he was not expelled, he would donate ten galleons. Upon being acquitted, Harry placed not just ten galleons, but the entire contents of his wallet into the fountain in triumph."

 "mirror of erised": {

  "summary": "The Mirror of Erised was a magical mirror, which, according to Albus Dumbledore, shows the \"deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts.\" The name \"Erised\" is \"desire\" spelled backwards, as if reflected in a mirror. The happiest and most satisfied person in the world would look in the mirror and see a reflection of them, exactly as they were, for they would then have no one and nothing more to yearn or desire for that the mirror could ever show them. But of course, it is intrinsically inherent for human nature to desire something greater than one's own self - meaning that an event wherein the mirror fails to carry out its intended purpose rarely, if at all, happens. The writing engraved on the frame of the mirror was supposedly in a foreign and probably dead language, but if one looked closely it said \"I show not your face but your heart's desire\" backwards, with the spaces rearranged. The mirror is one of those magical artefacts that seems to have been created in a spirit of fun (whether innocent or malevolent is a matter of opinion), because while it is much more revealing than a normal mirror, it is interesting rather than useful. Indeed, it became grimly apparent over the years that the mirror could bring more harm than good; many wasted their lives before the mirror, losing track of reality as they were deluded by what they saw and unable or unwilling to accept it as mere fantasy. Some were even driven mad by seeing their most desperate desire presented before them as a mere image confined within the frames of the mirror, unable to achieve what they are witnessing. A succession of teachers have brought back interesting artefacts from their travels, so it might have arrived at the castle in this casual manner, either because the teacher knew how it worked and was intrigued by it, or because they did not understand it and wished to ask their colleagues' opinions. In September of 1927, the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Albus Dumbledore looked into the mirror and saw his former best friend, Gellert Grindelwald, indicating he still has lingering feelings for him, as well an old memory of himself and Grindelwald in a barn where they made a blood pact; swearing an oath never to fight each other, showing that Albus still valued that memory, manifested before him by the mirror as his greatest desire, of the time when his friendship with Gellert was at its strongest that led to the two of them cementing it with the pact in the first place."

The ring passed through the male Gaunts, generation to generation, until it was stolen from Morfin Gaunt by Tom Riddle, while Tom framed Morfin for the murders of the Riddle family. Unknown to either Gaunt or Riddle, the stone was actually the legendary artifact known as the Resurrection Stone, and the \"coat of arms\" was the symbol of the Deathly Hallows. Tom did not enchant the ring right away, as he was seen wearing it while asking Horace Slughorn about Horcruxes, as seen through Slughorn's memories in a pensieve. The stone happened to be the Resurrection Stone, one of the Deathly Hallows of legend, and had the symbol of the Deathly Hallows engraved on its surface.

Flying carpets were particularly popular in Asia and the Middle East, with India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran and Mongolia among the main nations using them. Flying carpets were once an accepted form of travel for Great Britain's magical community, but they are now banned due to being defined as a Muggle Artefact by the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects. It is therefore now against wizarding law to charm carpets or fly them there, although they are still legal in other countries. It is known that the ban was relatively recent, not only from Arthur's involvement, but also from the fact that Barty Crouch Senior's grandfather owned a 12-seater Axminster back in the days before they were prohibited. The advantage of the carpet over a broomstick is that they can seat a number of people or luggage with ease, and are far more comfortable to ride on without having a Cushioning Charm placed on them, unlike broomsticks.

It was these many shared beliefs that led to both Dumbledore and Grindelwald making a Blood pact: a magical unity requiring two blood samples that seals the two creators' in a strong bond of unity and also forbids them from causing any harm or death to each other under any circumstances. However, Grindelwald was forced to leave Godric's Hollow after he had a duel with Dumbledore and his younger siblings, Aberforth Dumbledore and Ariana Dumbledore, in which Ariana tragically died. The duel was born from a heated arguement between Albus, Aberforth, and Gellert; caused by Aberforth berating Albus for his neglect of Ariana to carry out his plans of a peaceful revolution with Grindelwald. Though he considered the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak meaningless; he desired the Elder Wand; and sometime after 1899; he secretly stole it from Mykew Gregorovitch, a famous wandmaker who had the wand in his possession.

The barbarity of the conflict traumatised the Muggles for years to follow, and even the wizards developed a dread that the destructive weapons that had been used during the war might one day be used against them. The pure-blood supremacists of Europe also began to reassert their view that Muggles were inferior beings who deserved nothing but contempt, and that wizards needed to rise up and claim their right to rule. In the 1920s, the powerful wizard Gellert Grindelwald began to openly campaign against the International Statute of Secrecy, arguing that magical beings needed to emerge from hiding and take over for the greater good of wizards and Muggles both. Although Grindelwald was briefly arrested by MACUSA after the Obscurus Incident of New York in 1926, he escaped a year later and fled back to Europe. Arriving in Paris three months after his escape, Grindelwald gathered like-minded wizards to a rally in the Lestrange Mausoleum in the P\u00e8re-Lachaise cemetery. Laying a trail of breadcrumbs for wizards to follow, he drew Leta Lestrange, Newt Scamander, Tina and Queenie Goldstein, and Yusuf Kama to his rally. However, the most important of Grindelwald's 'guests' was the Obscurial Credence Barebone, a wizard who had been abused by his adoptive mother for his magic and whose power was great enough to allow him to survive the attack of MACUSA's Aurors in New York. Most of all, Grindelwald hoped to convert Credence to his cause, as he needed his power to defeat the only wizard who represented a threat to his cause: Albus Dumbledore, his old friend."

  "summary": "Evan Rosier (Between 1953 & 1966 \u2013 c. 1981) was a pure-blood wizard, possibly son of Rosier, and a Slytherin student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the 1970s. After graduating from Hogwarts, he became a Death Eater of Lord Voldemort and supported him in the First Wizarding War. Possibly related to Rosier or Druella, Evan attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1970s and was Sorted into Slytherin house. According to Sirius Black, he was part of a group of Slytherins and aspiring Death Eaters which included Severus Snape, as well as Wilkes, Avery and Mulciber. During the First Wizarding War, the Death Eaters were fiercely pursued by Aurors. Evan was eventually caught by famous Auror Alastor Moody around the same time as one of his comrades, Wilkes. The two resisted arrest, Rosier even blasting a significant part of Moody's nose off during their duel. A year later, Igor Karkaroff, while selling out his comrades to the Council of Magical Law in exchange for his own freedom, named Evan, but was informed of his death, making his naming of Rosier worthless. Little is known about Evan Rosier's personality, except the fact that he chose to resist and try to avoid imprisonment. Rosier was courageous enough to resist capture from the legendary Auror Alastor Moody, rather than flee to save his own neck, something that Slytherins (such as Phineas Nigellus Black) called \"bravery\"."

The Lestranges were among Lord Voldemort's most loyal and trusted servants, the only ones who searched for him after his first downfall. After Voldemort's first downfall, Rabastan, Rodolphus, his wife Bellatrix and Barty Crouch Jnr participated in the torture and permanent incapacitation of Alice and Frank Longbottom and were sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban. Rabastan later escaped with a group of Death Eaters and fought in several battles of the Second Wizarding War, including the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, and possibly the Battle of Hogwarts. After Lord Voldemort's final defeat, Rabastan was presumably killed, imprisoned in Azkaban once more or defected. Rabastan possibly attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was sorted into Slytherin house, like his brother Rodolphus. It is possible that he didn't attend Hogwarts at the same time as Rodolphus, as he was not mentioned among a small group of Slytherins and future Death Eaters, as Rodolphus and Bellatrix were. He, along with Rodolphus and Bellatrix, were among Voldemort's most loyal servants. Soon after the conflict ended in late 1981, Rabastan was put on trial with his brother Rodolphus, sister-in-law Bellatrix, and Barty Crouch Jnr for being a Death Eater and for participating in the torture of Alice and Frank Longbottom. Rabastan escaped Azkaban in 1996, along with his brother, sister-in-law and several other Death Eaters with the Dementors' defection to Voldemort, who had returned."

  "summary": "Lestrange was the surname of an ancient pure-blood wizarding family, originally from France but also with branches in Great Britain, and one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. Like the House of Black, many Lestranges practised the Dark Arts and believed in the notion of pure-blood supremacy, they disdained Muggles, Muggle-borns, blood traitors, and in some cases half-bloods. The Lestranges' family emblem was a raven, and their massive family vault was located in Paris, in the Cimeti\u00e8re du P\u00e8re-Lachaise. The family motto is \"Corvus oculum corvi non eruit\", which in English means \"a crow will not pull out the eye of another crow\". The Lestrange family, being named in the Pure-Blood Directory as one of the \"Sacred Twenty-Eight\" Pure-blood families, dated back centuries in the British wizarding community. The family produced a Minister for Magic during the 1800s: Radolphus Lestrange took a reactionary position, and attempted to shut down the Department of Mysteries, but was ignored by the Unspeakables and the rest of the Ministry. During her time at Hogwarts around the 1910s, Leta Lestrange developed a close relationship with fellow student and magical beast enthusiast Newton Scamander. After one of Leta's experiments went wrong and endangered the life of a student, Newt Scamander took the blame and was expelled in her place. During the First and Second Wizarding Wars, the Lestranges supported Lord Voldemort and at least a few members of the family were Death Eaters."

Golgomath also favoured the Death Eaters when they came to the colony to persuade the giants to rejoin Lord Voldemort's forces. Golgomath and the Death Eaters' envoy, Walden Macnair, got along very well, as they both loved to kill. Macnair and another Death Eater had been consorting with Golgomath for some time, visiting and offering gifts. Golgomath told Macnair about Hagrid and Madame Maxime being there, and eventually allied the giants with Lord Voldemort, and ordered his underlings to raid the caves of the valley for giants who didn't agree with Golgomath's leadership. It is unclear whether or not Golgomath was among the giants that fought at the Battle of Hogwarts, but given his status as Gurg, it is highly probable that he was. His ultimate fate following Voldemort's defeat is also unknown: he may have either returned to his position as Gurg, been challenged and defeated by another giant, or else been killed during or after the war for allying with the Death Eaters. He was one of the biggest giants among his colony, being about twenty-five feet tall, with matching black teeth and a necklace of bones, some of which looked like human bones. He did also get along with Death Eaters, especially the equally murderous Walden Macnair."

During the 1989\u20131990 school year, veteran Auror Alastor Moody explained to Jacob's sibling that a vast majority of Dark Wizards were tried by the Council of Magical Law. Notably, on the trial of Bartemius Crouch Jr and Rabastan, Rodolphus and Bellatrix Lestrange, the accused were not allowed to provide testimony before being given a life sentence in Azkaban; however, Sirius Black noted that this particular trial was no more than a sham for the elder Crouch to publicly disown his son. People external to the Council were, apparently, allowed to attend some of the trials, such as Rita Skeeter (on Ludo Bagman's trial) and Mrs Crouch (on her son's trial)."

In 1989 director Kenneth Branagh commissioned him to write the film score for Henry V. The song \"Non Nobis Domine\", from the film, was awarded the 1989 Ivor Novello Award for Best Film Theme. This led to several more collaborations with Branagh, and Doyle composed the scores for his films, Much Ado About Nothing, Frankenstein, Dead Again, As You Like It, Love's Labour's Lost, Thor and more. He has also composed numerous other film scores, including; Donnie Brasco, Carlito's Way, Eragon, Nim's Island, Calendar Girls, Gosford Park, and Sleuth. Though a composer by trade, Doyle often makes minor cameo appearances in films which he composes for, such as Frankenstein and As You Like It. He also composed the score for, and voiced a minor character in, the Disney/Pixar film Brave. In 1997, at age 44, Doyle was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (ACL), a form of blood cancer that kills 85 percent of its sufferers within three years.

Dirk attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1970s, becoming a favourite student of Potions Master Horace Slughorn. After graduating, he went to work at the Ministry and eventually became Head of the Goblin Liaison Office. When the Ministry was taken over by Lord Voldemort, Dirk attempted to use a forged family tree in order to claim wizarding heritage, but was discovered by Albert Runcorn. Dirk Cresswell was born sometime between September, 1960 and September, 1961, somewhere in the British Isles, into the Muggle Cresswell family. He showed magical abilities and, at the age of eleven, was invited to enrol at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which he did, having been Sorted on 1 September, 1972. Professor Horace Slughorn was his Potions Professor, and he considered Cresswell to be an exceptional student, inviting him to join the Slug Club. Sometime after graduating from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1979, Cresswell joined the Ministry of Magic. He eventually rose to the post of Head of the Goblin Liaison Office, succeeding Cuthbert Mockridge in either 1994, 1995, or 1996.

The show attempted to boost the morale of the allies involved in the anti-Voldemort movement by broadcasting supportive messages to Harry Potter and everyone else resisting the Death Eaters. In this sense, Potterwatch emulated the underground radio broadcasts that were transmitted in occupied countries during wartime in the Muggle world. They also tried to discourage the \"climate of panic\" being promoted by the Ministry by spreading the truth and dispelling rumours, such as one that Voldemort could kill people with only a glance. The programme content of the March, 1998 broadcast that Harry, Ron, and Hermione listened to before they were captured and briefly imprisoned in the Malfoy cellar was as follows:\nTo avoid detection by Voldemort, Death Eaters, or the puppet Ministry of Magic, Potterwatch did not broadcast every night and was broadcast from a different location each time. It is not entirely clear how this should prevent unauthorised access for a long time, as only one password would have to be guessed in order to gain knowledge of the next. It is possible that all passwords to access Potterwatch were related to the Order; presumably, however, only names of deceased members would be used as to not further condemn known living members.

The book was also very popular in Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts, when every copy was checked out of the library due to the reopening of the Chamber of Secrets. The book's original hand-written manuscript was stored in one of the Hogwarts Library's annexes, and could be only read by special appointment. It was Hermione Granger's favourite book, and she often referred to it on many things concerning Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Three of the things that she brought up are the Great Hall's Enchanted Ceiling that shows the weather outside, the fact that one could not apparate or disapparate on Hogwarts grounds and the fact that electronic devices did not work within the grounds. The book's removal from the Hogwarts Library when the Chamber of Secrets was opened caused Hermione great frustration, as despite her fondness for the book, she had left it behind that year due to lack of space because of the many texts assigned by Gilderoy Lockhart. However, Hermione showed slight frustration with the book when scathingly renaming the book in her fourth year, because it did not mention the use of house-elves at Hogwarts, even going so far as to suggest a couple of alternative titles for it: A Revised History of Hogwarts and A Highly Biased and Selective History of Hogwarts Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School. When the four greatest witches and wizards of their age, Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin, came together to establish a school for those with magical abilities, it was logical that they chose a location far away from the eyes of non-magical people due to the climate of persecution prevalent at that time. Records show that the Hogwarts founders worked together for several years, seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated."

He was responsible for a disastrous attempt to remove Peeves, the resident Poltergeist, in which he devised an elaborate trap baited with an assortment of weapons he believed would be irresistible to Peeves and a vast enchanted bell jar reinforced by various Containment Charms, which he intended to drop over the poltergeist once he was in place. The trap failed spectacularly, with Peeves confiscating the weapons, resulting in a three-day standoff. During his tenure, corporal punishment was allowed, and Mr Pringle was entitled to cane any student found wandering the corridors at night. At one time, at about four o'clock in the morning, he caught Arthur Weasley strolling about the castle and caned him while Molly Prewett, who had been with Arthur, escaped. It was said by Molly, in the 1994\u20131995 school year, that Arthur still had the marks inflicted on him. By 1973, Mr Pringle had retired, died, or left the school, and was replaced by Argus Filch and his cat, Mrs Norris. By at least 1973, Argus Filch, a Squib, had replaced Pringle as the caretaker of Hogwarts School.

Knowing nothing more than that it was \"for enemies\" and believing that the \"Half-Blood Prince\" (Snape's nickname signed into the book) merely copied it as a note of reference, Harry became interested in trying it. Harry initially considered using it against Cormac McLaggen for annoying him, though it was not until he confronted Draco Malfoy in Sixth-floor boys' bathroom that he tested it, seriously wounding Malfoy. Snape intervened to heal Draco, and having realised that Harry got a hold of his old textbook, he punished Harry with a multitude of detentions; though for fear of exposing himself as the curse's inventor, Snape chose not to turn Harry in for greater punishment. Despite disliking Malfoy, Harry did not want to harm him to such an extent, and was both horrified and guilt-ridden for using the curse against him, while reprimanding the Prince within his mind for adding such a deadly spell into his notes. Professor McGonagall considered Harry to be lucky not to have been expelled for such an act and full-heartedly supported the detentions, while Pansy Parkinson wasted no time in vilifying Harry far and wide; Ginny Weasley, however, stood up for Harry's usage of the curse, as it saved him from being struck by Malfoy's Cruciatus Curse. In an attempt to stop them, one spell Harry used was the Sectumsempra Curse, but it merely slashed their unfeeling flesh and did not seriously impede their approach."

For maximum effect of the spell, the incantation had to be repeated thrice; firstly slowing the flow of blood to prevent death by exsanguination; the second to clear residue and begin to heal the wounds; and the third to fully knit the wounds, although dittany had to be applied to prevent scarring. When Harry saw the damage inflicted onto Bill Weasley's face by the werewolf Fenrir Greyback after the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, he suggested to Madam Pomfrey to heal him with a charm, being influenced by seeing how Snape used this spell to heal Draco, until he was notified that cursed wounds cannot be healed by charms. Poppy Pomfrey may have used this spell in 1994 to repair a nasty cut to Harry Potter's shoulder after he was attacked by a Hungarian Horntail in the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament. Vulnera Sanentur derives from the Latin vulnus \"wound\", (in which the roots of the English \"vulnerable\" may be seen) and sanare, \"to heal\"; it is translated \"may the wounds be healed\"."

Because of this, it was not an unusual sight to see her retracing her steps through her hometown, attempting to use the Revealing Charm on every scrap of paper she came across, in search of a lost Arithmancy calculation. It was one day, during breakfast, that Wenlock wrote the immensely famous theorem that supported the magical properties of the number seven.

  "summary": "The Hungarian Horntail was a species of dragon native to Hungary, which was considered to be one of the most dangerous dragon breeds, if not the most dangerous. It also had yellow eyes, with vertical pupils like a cat's, bronze horns and similarly coloured spikes that protruded from its long tail which it would gladly deploy in combat. The dragon's roar was a yowling, screeching scream, and its flame could reach to about fifty feet. While having a very far reaching flame, the Horntail's breath could reach extremely high temperatures, as it made a stone turn red hot in seconds. The Horntail's foods of choice include cattle, sheep, goats, and whenever possible, humans. Horntails were also known for being one of the most vicious and aggressive breeds of dragon, and that was saying something since all dragons are known to be ferocious; even Rubeus Hagrid commented on their ferocity saying that the Horntail was a \"right nasty piece of work\". Along with their viciousness, tail spikes and fiery breath, Horntails were shown being extremely fast in flight while able to keep up with a Firebolt broomstick, a broom capable of going from 0 to 150 miles per hour in 10 seconds. At some point before or during the 1989\u20131990 school year, a Hungarian Horntail mistook Urgruff's egg as one of her own."

  "summary": "The Return of Lord Voldemort took place on the 24 June, 1995 in the graveyard of Little Hangleton, when Voldemort was restored to physical form and full magical power after being incorporeal for nearly fourteen years. The rebirth was the result of months of meticulous planning by Voldemort and his servants, Peter Pettigrew and Bartemius Crouch Junior, who manipulated the Triwizard Tournament being held at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry that year in order to deliver Harry Potter to Voldemort. Once Harry was delivered to Voldemort, Pettigrew murdered Cedric Diggory, who was transported along with Harry, and used some of Harry's blood in the ritual to restore Voldemort. Voldemort then called his Death Eaters to him and duelled Harry, who managed to escape and warn Albus Dumbledore. During Lord Voldemort's first rise to power, a prophecy was made about an infant with the power to defeat him who would be born to a couple who had thrice defied him. Voldemort marked Harry, son of Order of the Phoenix members James and Lily Potter, who had thrice defied Voldemort. The Potters went into hiding, yet Voldemort soon located them and arrived at their home in Godric's Hollow. The rebounding Killing Curse split Voldemort's already mangled soul once again; the piece of Voldemort's soul that broke off then attached itself to Harry's body, inadvertently turning him into a Horcrux. This marked the end of the First Wizarding War, after which many of Voldemort's followers were imprisoned in Azkaban or managed to convince the Ministry of Magic of their innocence."

However, this was not a completely safe method, as Golgomath ordered his subordinates to attack Hagrid for even setting foot into his territory, despite the fact that Hagrid came bearing a gift for him.

Jacob's sibling successfully cast the curse, giving the student an advantage in the subsequent duel with the creature. In 1994, while talking to Harry Potter through the Gryffindor Common Room fireplace, Sirius Black intended to suggest the use of this curse against the dragon Harry would be facing during the Triwizard Tournament , but was interrupted by Ron Weasley coming down the stairs because he heard voices."

  "summary": "Described as a \"dark\" and \"parasitic\" force, an Obscurus was created when the wizard child in question consciously attempted to repress their magical abilities or were forced to do so through physical or psychological abuse. When an Obscurial lost control, the Obscurus force was released, often focused on the cause of the Obscurial's torment, but also causing destruction in its wake. The Obscurus could be largely invisible or appear as a flying, incorporeal, and amorphous entity with the appearance of a black, fluid-like cloud, or a violent torrent of darkness, sometimes with a reddish core. There had also been instances when a face briefly emerged from the shadowy entity, or a white glowing image of the host appeared inside of it. The size and might of an Obscurus depended on the innate power of its host; the more powerful an Obscurial, the more powerful their Obscurus. When an Obscurial reached their emotional and mental breaking point, they could lose control completely and physically transform into an Obscurus. Its size and mass at specific times may also have been connected to the level of negative emotions that triggered it at that instance, as well as the current mental state of its host. However, they could be calmed down by someone they trust, which causes them to revert to their corporeal state, though being emotionally conflicted could cause the Obscurial to transform back and forth. An Obscurus often targeted people that were the source of their host's distress, as Credence Barebone's Obscurus went after Henry Shaw after he was insulted by him, though it took longer to attack Mary Lou Barebone since Credence was so emotionally close to her."

The inventor of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans was the eponymous Bertie Bott, who created them in the mid-20th century by mistake. He was planning on making tasty sweets from food, but accidentally made one taste like a dirty sock. According to Ron Weasley, there are ordinary flavours like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but also more adventuresome ones like spinach and liver and tripe.

It was ironically a difficult potion to make, requiring that the brewer followed the directions carefully, because making a mistake could have drastic consequences. Adding too much of the ingredients, for instance, would put the drinker of the potion into a deep \u2014 and possibly irreversible \u2014 sleep. Ingredients had to be added in the exact order and amounts specified, and the potion needed to be stirred seven times, both clockwise and counter-clockwise. Before the addition of the final ingredient, hellebore, the temperature of the flames had to be lowered, and the potion allowed to simmer for seven minutes. If brewed correctly, the potion would emit a silvery vapour, but the possible characteristics of a failed batch seemed to be endless (everything from green sparks, dark grey steam, a sulphurous odour, a cement-like consistency, to a dangerous instability that would cause it to explode and set one's robes alight)."

 "alchemy": {
  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Alchemy",
  "summary": "Alchemy is a branch of magic and an ancient science concerned with the study of the composition, structure and magical properties of the four basic elements, as well as the transmutation of substances; it is thus intimately connected with Potion-making, chemistry and transformation magic. Alchemy also concerns philosophy; one interpretation of alchemical literature, which is known to be dominated by mystical and metaphysical speculation, were that the study of Alchemy were symbolic of a spiritual journey, leading the alchemist from ignorance (base metal) to enlightenment (gold). While Muggles for the most part largely dismiss it as an outdated forerunner of modern chemistry, there were still wizards actively studying and practising it in the twentieth century and who held it to be some of the most difficult magic known to wizardkind. A less well known branch of the study of alchemy was Spagyric, or \"plant alchemy\". A non-magical version of this study also existed, called Muggle alchemy. As the time went on, the lack of common words for chemical concepts and processes, as well as the need for secrecy (presumably to avoid Muggle persecution) led alchemists to borrow the terms and symbols of biblical and pagan mythology, astrology, kabbalah and other esoteric fields. However, this also ended up making the plainest chemical recipe read like an abstruse magic incantation, probably confusing the learning and spreading of alchemy as a science. Dzou Yen, widely considered one of the fathers of Chinese scientific thought, was an alchemist in the fourth century B.C., during the final years of the Zhou Dynasty. The best known goals of the alchemists were the transformation of common metals into gold (a phenomenon called Chrysopoeia) or silver, the creation of a Panacea, a remedy that would cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely, and the discovery of a universal solvent."

However, because Boggarts are amortal, this spell does not truly destroy them, similar to the Patronus Charm, but merely \"banish\" them \u2014 meaning the defeated Boggart will vanish, and presumably re-materialise elsewhere. At the start of the 1986\u20131987 school year, Professor Pomona Sprout used this spell to banish a Boggart that manifested in the Greenhouse after Herbology class. Throughout the school year, Jacob's sibling used this spell on various occasions against Boggarts that had been released due to someone having tampered with the Vault of Fear, including the infiltration of the Vault by themselves. During the Calamity of the 2010s, members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force often used this charm to combat Boggart Confoundables in order to release Foundables. A simple charm that required the force of mind, to cast, the spell caster must first acknowledge what they fear the most (as it will most likely be what the Boggart will take the form of) and then visualise it into something amusing. The problem was because the Boggart would have assumed said form at the moment of direct encounter, the one attempting to use this charm would have lost concentration after seeing the Boggart manifest their worst fears, making this spell useless."

In a 1913 Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry concerning Boggarts, a student's Boggart changed into a shark, to which the student used the Boggart-Banishing Spell to turn it into a flotation device. In 1995, for the second task of the Triwizard Tournament which took place in the Great Lake at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Viktor Krum partially transfigured himself into a shark to complete it."

Many years before September 1986, the Vault of Fear was found and many boggarts were unleashed in the school. Jacob had found the Vault of Fear and left behind a map of the Forbidden Forest and an arrow. In the 1986\u20131987 school year, the vault was tampered with by an unknown person. Jacob's sibling eventually found the vault and objects left by Jacob. They fooled the vault into thinking that Jacob's wand, found in the Vault of Ice the year before, was their own and that they had sacrificed their own magic. It was guarded by the boggarts, which in Jacob's sibling's case took the form of three Voldemorts."

 "cursed vaults": {
  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Cursed_Vaults",
  "summary": "The Cursed Vaults were five legendary hidden rooms at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, each vault shielded by a different curse placed on it. Some alleged that the vaults housed priceless treasures such as gold, prophecies, and other powerful magical artefacts dating back to before the school was founded while others believed they contained Dark Magic. Albus Dumbledore's research into the vaults revealed that a terrible amount of work had gone into their construction and that one could only guess that whatever they were built to hold, it followed that it was even more incredibly dangerous and complex than the magic used to make the vaults themselves, not to mention that whatever they contained would be likely to be far more terrible. Among the many theories circulating, Albus Dumbledore mentions two, that they were created by the Hogwarts founders themselves or that they were created by a Headmaster who suffered from paranoia, but he might have been trying to discourage Jacob's sibling from continuing their research into the vaults. The Gryffindor House ghost, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, later explained to the same student that because Hogwarts Castle was always intended as a safe place, the school shouldered the responsibility of safeguarding and protecting that which was dangerous from falling into the wrong hands, and carrying the burden of the job remarkably well despite the fact that subsequent heads of the school and members of the faculty came to recognise how it, to some extent, compromised the security of the castle. Sir Nicholas believed that while there was a general consensus among those who believed that the Cursed Vaults were real that they were most likely originally made to protect something dangerous by people wanting to take advantage of the school's ever-changing floorplan to make their locations more difficult to find, it was also possible that the vaults were created around something dangerous that could not be moved. Among them were the Professors Fortinbras and Bartholomew, who were involved in the creation of a 'circle of trust' consisting of a group of teachers and students who all worked together researching the vaults with the intent of putting an end to the threat they posed to the school. During her school career, Patricia Rakepick did research into the existence and reportedly tried to warn her teachers of the existence of the Cursed Vaults, to no avail. At some point during his magical education, a student named Jacob went looking for those vaults, endangering the whole school in the process, for which he was expelled."

It is safe to assume that the art had been around for a fairly long time, as Salazar Slytherin, a very skilled Legillimens, lived in the 11th century, and, along with the other Hogwarts founders, enchanted the Sorting Hat to have the skill. Whereas most had to learn Legilimency, Queenie was born with a great aptitude for the skill. Throughout their school years, Jacob's sibling would occasionally receive visions revealing information about the Cursed Vaults and the next step towards finding them. While Jacob's sibling initially believed that these may be visions of the future, the visions were later revealed to be deliberate messages from their brother. The student was also sometimes able to receive insights into their opponent's next move while duelling, even without casting the spell."

Not counting Herpo the Foul, who predated him by several centuries, nearly all known Parselmouths were descended from Salazar Slytherin, with Harry Potter being a notable exception (although he gained his ability as a Parselmouth in an unorthodox manner). Parseltongue was, when spoken, a hissing sound, similar to that of a snake; as such, normal people could not understand it (one known exception being Dumbledore). Apart from merely communicating with serpentine lifeforms, Parselmouths also seemed to be able to influence the will of serpents to a certain extent. Aside from serpent-based creatures, Parselmouths could communicate with each other with the language, as Harry understood Tom Riddle's commands to the Serpent of Slytherin, and the House of Gaunt communicated with each other almost exclusively in Parseltongue. The ability to actually speak Parseltongue \u2014 not just imitate it as Ron Weasley did \u2014 was considered an attribute of a Dark Wizard, which was partly due to the fact that both Salazar Slytherin and Lord Voldemort possessed this ability. However, as Albus Dumbledore pointed out, there were Parselmouths among the great and good as well, the most well-known of which was Harry Potter. Paracelsus, a notable alchemist and a \"medical genius\", was credited with the discovery of Parseltongue in the sixteenth century, despite the existence of speakers like Herpo the Foul or Salazar Slytherin in the classical and medieval ages."

During the 1987\u20131988 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Transfiguration Professor Minerva McGonagall taught this spell to her fourth-years, including Jacob's sibling. This spell was utilised by Draco Malfoy during the first Duelling Club meeting in 1992 at the advice of Snape, summoning forth a black serpent in an attempt to attack Harry Potter. After a failed attempt by Gilderoy Lockhart to dispose of it, Harry spoke to the snake with Parseltongue, inadvertently revealing his status as a Parselmouth to the school. Snape's enjoyment at Harry's horror turned to horror himself at this discovery, and he obliterated the snake, vanishing it in a cloud of black smoke."

During the 1987\u20131988 school year, this spell was taught to fourth-years in Transfiguration at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In 1991, Harry Potter may have used this spell unintentionally to make the glass at the Zoo disappear. In 1992, after being forced to take a photo with Gilderoy Lockhart for Colin Creevey and then asked to sign it, Harry wished he knew a good Vanishing Spell to escape the embarrassment. In May 1993, Neville Longbottom may have used this spell unintentionally during a Transfiguration lesson, in which Professor McGonagall stated that all students would still be having their end of year exams in one week, despite the attacks on students and the suspension of Albus Dumbledore and Rubeus Hagrid. During the 1995\u20131996 school year, Professor Minerva McGonagall introduced this spell in her very first Transfiguration class with the fifth-year students, giving them a lecture and then setting them on vanishing snails."

Umbridge kept making annoying scratching sounds with her note-writing, as well as making remarks against Harry's ambition of being an Auror. She essentially suggested it would not be possible due to Harry's \"criminal record\" (which has been cleared) and poor marks in Defence Against the Dark Arts, specifically her classes (which was dismissed by McGonagall). Professor McGonagall was at first impartial with Harry's choice of career, even suggesting he look for another career path as his current marks require a little extra effort to make it through the cut. But with Umbridge's constant interruptions and insults, the meeting ended up with Professor McGonagall supporting Harry, and having a screaming argument with Umbridge. Ultimately, Professor McGonagall's insistence of Harry's success was proven correct."

When she became afraid that her mother's job at the Ministry of Magic might be threatened by her membership in the organisation, Marietta betrayed the D.A. This activated a jinx that caused boils to erupt on Marietta's face, and a Memory Charm was later placed on her by Kingsley Shacklebolt to prevent her from fully incriminating her fellow D.A. Marietta began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as early as 1990 and as late as 1993. When Harry asked Cho to the Yule Ball, Marietta was amongst the group of friends to giggle at the boy, much to Harry's discomfort.

Ted was born into the Tonks family but, unlike his Muggle relatives, was a wizard.

  "summary": "Astrology is the system of using the relative positions of celestial bodies (including the sun, moon, and planets) to try to predict future events or gain insight into personality, relationships, and health. One human astrological practise was to draw a circular chart, called a personal chart, showing the position of the planets at the time of a person's birth. Creating one was an intensive process, requiring the consultation of timetables, as well as the calculation of angles. Once completed, this chart could be used in combination with data on upcoming planetary movements to work out a personal forecast, called a horoscope. Alchemists, because of the lack of common words for chemical processes as well as the need for secrecy, borrowed terms from astrology and other mystic and esoteric fields. By 1995, it ran horoscopes on the back page, as well as a feature on page six called Astro News, which was presumably dedicated to astrology. The horoscope column was moved to an interior page by 1997, and by that time was being written by Limunus. Like humans, centaurs practised astrology, but their approach to it was different. While centaurs used astrology only to foresee major, world-changing events, humans also utilised it to predict mundane, day-to-day occurrences and better understand themselves. According to Firenze, his species spent hundreds of years observing celestial movements, unlocking their secrets and thereby learning to see signs of \"great tides of evil or change\" to come written in the sky."

A few months into the marriage, she became pregnant and stopped the doses of Love Potion, presumably because she believed that Tom had come to genuinely love her or would stay with her for the benefit of their child."

The Knight Bus was a relatively modern invention in wizarding society, which sometimes (though it would rarely admit it) took ideas from the Muggle world. The need for some form of transportation that could be used safely and discreetly by the underage or the infirm had been felt for a while and many suggestions had been made (sidecars on taxi-style broomsticks, carrying baskets slung under Thestrals) all of them vetoed by the Ministry. While some wizards (mainly pure-blood fanatics) announced their intention of boycotting what was dubbed \"this Muggle-esque outrage\" in the letters page of the Daily Prophet, the Knight Bus proved hugely popular with most of the community and remained busy to this day. During the early 1990s, the Knight Bus's conductor was Stan Shunpike, who greeted passengers and handled baggage, and was driven by Ernie Prang. Inside, during the night, the Knight Bus had beds, curtained windows and candles burning in brackets beside each bed. The bus did not seem to have much in the way of safety features, as passengers and luggage alike usually got thrown around the inside of the bus during its haphazard manoeuvres."

Harry's wand was broken in 1997, but was repaired by him after the 1998 Battle of Hogwarts. Harry obtained his wand from Ollivander, at a price of seven Galleons, just before his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Despite his wand being brothers with Lord Voldemort's wand, noted by Ollivander after Harry's wand had been chosen, Harry generally did not put much thought into this connection at first, regarding the relationship as something that the wand could not help, any more than he could help being related to his aunt Petunia Dursley. Harry wielded this wand throughout his Hogwarts career and demonstrated his growing magical skill, particularly in Defence Against the Dark Arts and duelling. Harry has also performed powerful magic with this wand, such as the very advanced Patronus Charm (at age thirteen), an impressive Shield Charm, and many other advanced spells he had to learn at a young age. When Harry entered the Chamber of Secrets and confronted a fragment of Lord Voldemort's soul via his diary Horcrux, the manifested soul took the wand that Harry dropped when he rushed to an unconscious Ginny Weasley, and used it to write his full name in fiery letters and then reorganised them into the phrase \"I am Lord Voldemort\"."

Tulip and Merula soon stumbled upon Jacob's old research room, but then started to gather information behind the others back, thus causing a falling out. They locked the room with two keys, one for each of them, so that neither could do any research nor could anyone else get in. In the 1986\u20131987 school year, upon noticing Tulip's name on the lock outside Jacob's room, Jacob's sibling, who was in the same year as Tulip, brought a friend to meet her in the Transfiguration Classroom for the first time, attempting to gain information from her."

This attack resulted in Grindelwald's unmasking and capture by the MACUSA, the believed destruction of Credence Barebone, and a massive breach of the International Statute of Secrecy. In 1926, Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald infiltrated MACUSA by assuming the identity of Auror Percival Graves using Human Transfiguration. Grindelwald believed the mysterious attacks occurring in New York City to be the work of a powerful Obscurial, which he felt would be a great asset for his plans of world domination. Believing Credence was an orphaned Squib, Grindelwald emotionally manipulated him into helping him find the Obscurial. During this time, Grindelwald (as Graves) arrested Newt Scamander, whose escaped beasts were believed by the MACUSA to be the cause of the Obscurial's attacks. During his interrogation, Grindelwald discovered the Obscurus within Newt's suitcase, and in an effort to hide his tracks, had him and Tina Goldstein sentenced to death. Afterwards, he approached Credence after Mary Lou Barebone was killed by the Obscurial and had him track down his adopted sister Modesty Barebone, believing her to be the source of the Obscurus. This angered Credence, who then revealed that he was the Obscurial, much to Grindelwald's surprise."

Human Transfiguration could be used to essentially replicate the natural abilities of Metamorphmagi, allowing the practitioner or the subject to take on an entirely different form or make various individual changes to their appearance, such as growing or changing the colour, style or pattern of one's hair or taking on individual animal body parts. However, while human Transfiguration could presumably be performed by any wizard who was skilled enough, on themselves as well as on others, a Metamorphmagus was born with the ability to make such changes to their own bodies with little to no effort and without the use of a wand. Although it was possible to transfigure humans into inanimate objects, it is unknown how someone who had himself transfigured into an object would be able to untransfigure without the intervention of another witch or wizard."

The hall was ornately decorated with flags and other patriotic emblems; at the far end of the room, behind a stage, was a huge poster bearing Senator Shaw's likeness under a slogan that read \"America's Future\". Following dinner, an announcer stepped to the stage to present the night's keynote speaker, Senator Shaw himself (while, in the process, cracking a joke about the Senator's father's media empire slating him as a potential future President of the United States, and receiving indulgent laughter from the crowd). Shaw came up to the stage under tumultuous applause and proceeded to deliver a speech about the progress that had been accomplished with Prohibition, and advocating that \"the pool halls, and these private parlours\" went the way of the \"odious saloons\". As Shaw was speaking, he was interrupted by a strange, haunting noise coming from the organ pipes at the end of the room; and as he recommenced, the strange noise got louder, prompting the guests to look around for the source of the disruption and worriedly start to mutter to each other. The Obscurus soared across the hall, sending tables flying and throwing people around as it carved a line toward the stage where Shaw was still standing. The force threw Shaw backwards against his poster, and then raised him up high where he was suspended for just a moment in midair before being thrown violently back down onto the stage, dead. Then the soup, cream of fresh mushroom, was served, followed by the fish course (filet of sole), and then a roast (saddle of mutton with mint sauce, with Delmonico potatoes and stringless beans) and salad (tomatoes stuffed with celery)."

He became friends with the seventeen year old Albus Dumbledore, and they both became obsessed with the powerful objects known as the Deathly Hallows. This caused the end of Dumbledore and Grindelwald's friendship, and forced Grindelwald to flee, going on later to raise an Army in an attempt to continue his plan of wizarding domination. Grindelwald soon tracked down the Elder Wand, stole it from Gregorovitch, and began to amass power. As his machinations played out over the next 45 years, he became one of the most powerful Dark Wizards in history, and a serious threat to the Wizarding World. Meanwhile, Dumbledore had become the Transfiguration Professor and Deputy Headmaster of Hogwarts, and gained a considerable reputation for his wisdom and achievements along the way.

According to legend, Antioch's throat was slit in his sleep the night after winning his first duel with the Elder Wand. It is unknown if Antioch was really murdered, though given the Elder Wand's violent history, it seems likely, or if he had any descendants. The legend also says that Cadmus committed suicide after using the Resurrection Stone to bring back his beloved, having found the experience completely unfulfilling. However, given that the Gaunts appear to be descended from Cadmus, as they possessed the Stone, it would seem Cadmus lived long enough to, at the very least, sire children, and it is likely that his beloved, who had died an untimely death, may have died in childbirth. The legend eventually says that Ignotus lived a long and fulfilling life and, having decided to elude Death no longer, passed the Cloak of Invisibility on to his own son. His lineage is the easiest of the brothers' to trace, as the cloak would continue to be handed down from parent to child through the generations, finally coming into Harry's possession. Dumbledore believed it far more likely the three Peverells were the creators of the Hallows and the legend to be merely a story partially inspired by their nature, which would account for how Cadmus sired a child despite the legend implying he committed suicide soon after obtaining the stone, and for how Ignotus sired a child to inherit his possessions with the legend implying he hid from Death for the rest of his life soon after obtaining the cloak."

Three brothers, travelling along a lonely, winding road at twilight reached a deep treacherous river where anyone who attempted to swim or wade would drown. Learned in the magical arts, the brothers conjured a bridge with their wands and proceed to cross. The eldest brother, a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence. The second brother, an arrogant man, chose to further humiliate death, and asked for the power to recall the deceased from the grave.

However, like Altheda, Asha could also be a realist, which may make her seem ungenerous in a way, especially given how she became angry with Amata for accidentally bringing along Sir Luckless with them on their quest, and only changed her mind when Amata herself became angry with Sir Luckless and scolded him into helping them on their journey. It must be noted, though, that her illness could possibly serve as a justifiable reason for her anger and disapproval of Sir Luckless joining in the quest, especially since only one was allowed to bathe in the Fountain."

The warlock's ability to remove his own heart from his own body and preserve his own life with it stored externally is considered an impossibility outside of fairy tales, as Albus Dumbledore commented. The main character of the story is a handsome, skilled and rich young warlock who saw emotions as a weakness, and decides to take measures to prevent himself from ever falling in love, using the Dark Arts. The Warlock becomes deluded, believing himself to be envied for his \"perfect\" solitude, which makes him all the more upset to overhear two servants talking about him; one servant is taking pity on him, while the other is ridiculing him for not having found a wife. This swings a blow to the Warlock's pride, and he decides to find a beautiful, magically talented and wealthy young maiden, so that he will be envied by all. The next day, he has the fortune of meeting such a woman; though the maiden is both \"fascinated and repelled\" by the Warlock, he persuades her, along with her family, to come to a dinner feast at his castle.

The maiden asks the Warlock to put his heart back inside his chest, which he does.

During the course of his career as a wandmaker, Gregorovitch became an expert in wandlore and supplied many witches and wizards in European countries with reliable wands. While Ollivander did not agree with many of Gregorovitch's conclusions, they did concur about hawthorn wands, which were complex and intriguing in their natures. At some point in his life, Gregorovitch came into the possession of the Elder Wand, one of the Deathly Hallows and the most powerful wand in existence, and upon realising its true nature, he began experimenting to try and duplicate its powers. Gregorovitch, somewhat foolish by nature and hoping it would improve business, or perhaps trying to outsource some fresh outside talent that could assist him in his grander endeavours, started a rumour about him possessing a powerful wand and his efforts to replicate its properties. The man was in fact Gellert Grindelwald, although Gregorovitch never lived long enough to find out who stole the wand.

But Amata got tangled in the armour of a knight, and as the vines pulled Asha in, all three witches along with the knight were pulled through the wall and into the garden. Since only one person is permitted to bathe in the Fountain, the first two witches were upset that Amata had inadvertently invited another competitor. Because he had no magical power, he recognised the women as witches, and was well-suited to his name, \"Sir Luckless,\" the knight announced his intention to abandon the quest."

  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Warlock",
  "summary": "In The Tales of Beedle the Bard, Albus Dumbledore mentions an old magazine called Warlock at War - this was written by Brutus Malfoy and was essentially concerning the war he felt was between pure-bloods and Muggles. The term here may have been used to draw on the fact that warlocks were skilled in warrior magic, as well as it being used synonymously with wizard. Also in the book, there is a story called The Warlock's Hairy Heart, which concerns a warlock engaging in dark magic. The Sunday edition of The New York Ghost published on 28 November 1926 reported a dispute by warlocks due to the Crystal Ball Regulation at the time. The Sunrise Early Edition of The New York Ghost published on 30 May 1927 had an article located on page 3, column 2 regarding Alaska warlocks being suspected of contraband. The Anglo-Saxon waerloga or \"oathbreaker\", which passed through a Middle English form of warloghe or warlach to become warlock, has two components, waer \"covenant\", and loga \"betrayal\". The word could possibly derive from the Norse word vardlokkur, meaning \"Wise Man\" or \"Wise Wizard\". More specifically, a man with the power of binding spirits by channelling or using tools such as runes and knot-magic, as well as a label for the Gate Keepers or Guardians who protected spiritual knowledge and wisdom."

The Warlock thus took her down to the dungeon of the castle and showed her an enchanted crystal casket, within which lay his own beating heart. The heart, however, has become horrible in the long time that it has been separated from the body, and the scent of her golden hair, the silken touch of her soft white arms, and the gentle musical sound of her breath in his ear all pierced it. The Warlock cut her breast open, so he could exchange her heart for his hairy one. The Warlock attempted to flatter the maiden, but she confronts him saying that she would only believe these lovely words if she thought he had a heart. The warlock then took her to the deepest dungeon to show his most valuable treasure, his own beating heart."

Myrtle had haunted the bathroom ever since the Ministry of Magic stopped her from haunting Olive Hornby who had been teasing Myrtle just before her death, leading it to be a place most students do not want to enter. To get in the Chamber, a person needed to say \"open\" in Parseltongue, which would cause the tap with a snake on the side (a tap which incidentally, never worked) to move into the floor, revealing a tunnel which led downwards into the Chamber. Hogwarts Castle and this bathroom were built by Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin. According to an ancient legend, Salazar Slytherin was responsible for the construction of the Chamber of Secrets beneath Hogwarts dungeons. The Chamber contained a Basilisk which could only be controlled by Slytherin's true heir, and use it to purge the school of all muggle-born students. Before being forced out of Hogwarts by the other founders, Slytherin hid the entrance to the Chamber. Several centuries later in the 1700s, a direct of descendant of Slytherin, Corvinus Gaunt, further concealed the passageway behind a bewitched sink that could be only opened by someone who spoke Parseltongue. For centuries, the Castle was thoroughly searched and no such Chamber was found until one of Slytherin's descendants set foot in the Castle in the late 1930s. In 1938, Tom Riddle (best known by the alias \"Lord Voldemort\") started his education at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In his fifth year, he learned of his Slytherin ancestry and discovered the existence and entrance to the Chamber of Secrets and tamed the Basilisk which dwelt within. As the Heir of Slytherin through his mother's family, Tom was able to open the Chamber of Secrets and started purging the school \"of all those who were unworthy to study magic\" - in Riddle and Slytherin's eyes, those were Muggle-born students."

Around 1634, Gormlaith found out a headteacher at a new school of magic in the New World was nicknamed \"Morrigan\".

The battle occurred on 27 July, 1997, when several members of the Order of the Phoenix were ambushed by Death Eaters while removing Harry Potter from the home of his only relatives, the Dursley family. The Order managed to get Harry to safety, but suffered the loss of their leader, Alastor Moody, and Harry's owl, Hedwig, in the process. Voldemort learned of this protection, and thus sought to find and kill Harry when the Order of the Phoenix removed him as he came of age. By July 1997, there had been another break-out of Death Eaters from Azkaban and Voldemort had enough control over the Ministry of Magic to observe any Apparition, Portkey use, or Floo Network activity from the Dursleys' home, but the Order mistrusted the Ministry and made other plans, thus Voldemort was not privy to the whole plan and only part of it (namely, by using untraceable transport). In order to preserve his position as a trusted Death Eater, Severus Snape was forced to tell Voldemort the true date at which the Order planned to move Harry. However, he placed a Confundus Charm on Order member Mundungus Fletcher so that the other wizard would suggest a plan to have six others disguise themselves as Harry through the use of Polyjuice Potion to act as decoys. However, they accepted the plan to have seven Harry Potters, each escorted by an Order member acting as a protector, and fly away from Little Whinging, as no other method of transportation was safe."

Wizards who could not Apparate (dematerialise and reappear at will), who wished to travel by daylight (meaning that broomsticks, Thestrals, flying cars and dragons would be inappropriate), or whose destination had no fireplace (rendering Floo powder useless) would have to resort to the use of a Portkey. When secrecy was paramount, and mass movement was planned, the chosen Portkey would be a nondescript object secreted in an out-of-the-way place, so that it would be taken for a piece of unimportant debris by Muggle passers-by. Accidents were still known to occur, however; two Muggle dog-walkers found themselves accidentally transported to a Celestina Warbeck concert in 2003, because their dogs had run off with an old trainer on Clapham Common (leaving an anguished crowd of witches and wizards to look frantically for their Portkey on a stretch of empty grass, hopefully seizing old crisp packets and cigarette ends). While the Memory Charm placed upon him by a harried Ministry official seemed to take at the time, he later wrote a popular Muggle song that bore an uncanny resemblance to Celestina's worldwide hit (Ms Warbeck was not amused).

  "summary": "However, the effectiveness of burnings involving actual witches and wizards was questionable, as many, such as Wendelin the Weird, were able to escape death by using the Flame-Freezing Charm. As the witch-hunts grew ever fiercer, British wizarding families began to live double lives, using charms of concealment to protect themselves and their families. Though witch-hunts rarely ever caught actual witches or wizards, their vicious nature and widespread dispersal meant that major wizarding institutions such as schools (most notably including Hogwarts and Ilvermorny) and governments (such as the British Ministry and MACUSA) were established in highly remote places and/or concealed by powerful magical means. Indeed it was the trauma of the Trials and pressure from similar witch-hunts that led to the foundation of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy in 1692, whereupon wizards disappeared into hiding and erased all traces of their existence to avoid persecution. It became common for wizarding families to band together for safety in numbers and establish their own \"communities within a community\" in Muggle villages, including the villages of Godric's Hollow, Tinworth and Ottery St Catchpole. The Scourer descendant Bartholomew Barebone prompted a brief resurgence of witch-hunting in the 1700s when he tricked the American witch Dorcus Twelvetrees into divulging many secrets of the wizarding world in America, including the locations of both Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the headquarters of MACUSA, and used this information as well as the wand he stole from her to try and expose the existence of wizards. Barebone was taken seriously enough by some to prompt investigations into the matter, with Barebone himself taking a number of associates and ambushing a group of people they assumed to be wizards emerging from the MACUSA headquarters but who turned out to be innocent Muggles. Though nobody was killed and Barebone was quickly incarcerated and discredited, the fact that the wizarding community had come within a hair's breadth of being exposed prompted the enactment of Rappaport's Law, which segregated the magical and non-magical peoples of North America completely."

Despite of the revisions he did to these tales, however, they were completely believable and accurately described how to confront and handle a myriad dangerous situations; seen as how his books received best-seller status and even former teachers thought they might have misjudged him when word reached Hogwarts of all the feats of bravery he was said to have been credited with after his graduation. These accounts included:\nLockhart assigned seven of his books for all students the 1992\u20131993 school year of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for Defence Against the Dark Arts, each of which costs 5 galleons, resulting in an expensive 35 galleons book list. Lockhart gave Harry Potter a complete set of his collected works for appearing with him in a photo op for the Daily Prophet in Flourish and Blotts, though Potter had no desire for the event or the books, and donated them to Ginny Weasley. Although Lockhart was a fraud and his books depicted him accomplishing feats far beyond his abilities, it is possible that the \"wealth of invented details\" Lockhart added was merely literary devices to make the dangers described sound more profound and the tales of how they were overcome more thrilling to the reader, but otherwise contain instructive safety- and survival tips on how to get out of encounters with various dangerous, dark creatures alive. After all, Hermione Granger would have unlikely considered taking one of Lockhart's books with them on the Horcrux hunt, if its content could not be applied practically in fending off dark creatures such as those they might encounter out in the real life."

These lessons took place in the History of Magic Classroom using a Boggart that Lupin had managed to locate hiding inside Filch's filing cabinet, which he then placed inside of an old packing case. When the lessons started and the packing case was opened in front of Harry, the Boggart would take the form of his worst fear, a Dementor, on which Harry would then attempt to perform the Patronus Charm. Although the Dementor was fake, it still produced similar effects on Harry, and Lupin would give him some chocolate after each lesson to soothe the effects. When informed of this situation, Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge took many proactive measures in order to corral Black once more. At the beginning of the school year, fearing that Black might attempt to kill Harry Potter, Fudge dispatched the Dementors to protect Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and search Hogsmeade village. Once the Dementor was gone and Harry and his friends had eaten some chocolate, they all began feeling much better."

He was replaced as Minister for Magic by Rufus Scrimgeour, but stayed in an advisory capacity and communicated news of the Second Wizarding War to the Muggle Prime Minister if Scrimgeour was unable to."

This law was one of the causes that contributed to the later Goblin Rebellions of the eighteenth century, given the anger expressed by some goblins, such as Griphook, about wizards denying goblins the right to use wands. For example, Hagrid was a half-giant, and while a pure giant would not be permitted to carry a wand under Clause Three, he had a wizard father and was therefore part-human and permitted to carry a wand. Werewolves, on the other hand, were recognised as humans afflicted with lycanthropy and were permitted to carry wands, though in their transformed state they lost the ability to practise magic as a normal witch or wizard."

  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Ravenclaw_Tower",
  "summary": "Ravenclaw Tower was one of the three tallest towers of Hogwarts Castle, alongside Gryffindor Tower and the Astronomy Tower. The entrance to the common room was located on the west side of Hogwarts at the top of a spiral staircase, presumably located on the fifth floor, and was a door without a doorknob or keyhole, but a bronze knocker in the shape of an eagle. In order to enter the room, a person must answer a riddle asked by the eagle knocker; if they answered incorrectly, they must wait for someone else who got it right. It was a wide, circular room with arched windows hung with blue and bronze silks and a midnight blue carpet covered in stars, which was reflected onto the domed ceiling. The room was furnished with tables, chairs, and bookcases; and by the door leading up to the dormitories stood a tall statue of Rowena Ravenclaw made of white marble. During the day, Ravenclaw students had an excellent view of the school grounds, including the lake, Forbidden Forest, Quidditch pitch, Herbology gardens and the surrounding mountains. The entrance to the\u00a0Ravenclaw dormitories were also located in the Tower, beside a statue of Rowena Ravenclaw. On 1 May 1998, Harry Potter and Luna Lovegood ventured into Ravenclaw Tower in the hopes of locating the legendary Ravenclaw's Diadem."

  "summary": "The Slytherin Dungeon, also known as the Slytherin Common Room, served as the common room for students in Slytherin house at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In Harry Potter's second year, he and Ron Weasley went into the Slytherin common room disguised as Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle with the aid of Polyjuice Potion to attempt to discover the identity of the Heir of Slytherin. The Polyjuice Potion's wearing off prompted Harry and Ron to leave after staying nearly an hour, still not finding out the identity of the Heir of Slytherin, but they did learn that Malfoy was not the heir, as they originally thought. In 1998, Harry, operating under the alias \"Vernon Dudley\", attempted to defend his false claim that he was a member of the Slytherin house by describing the location of the Dungeon to the Snatchers. There is a door on the right side of the Entrance Hall (if coming down the marble staircase facing the front doors of the castle) that is most frequently used by Slytherin students to get to their common room. The entrance to the common room is located behind a bare stretch of stone wall in the dungeons of Hogwarts Castle. The common room has lots of low backed black and dark green button-tufted, leather sofas; skulls; and dark wood cupboards."

The Palace of Beauxbatons was built in around the 13th century in the south of France, in the Pyrenees. At Christmas time, the Dining Chamber was adorned and decorated with huge, beautiful ice-sculptures which didn't melt, and the students eating in the hall were serenaded by choirs of wood nymphs. In the Beauxbatons park stood the Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel Fountain, which was believed to hold healing and beautifying powers. Students in their sixth year of study took their first set of examinations, which were, presumably, equivalent to the British Ordinary Wizarding Level, which was taken in fifth year. In December, the dining hall (possibly the equivalent of the Great Hall) was decorated with huge ice sculptures, which didn't melt. The Academy also took part in the Triwizard Tournament, which took place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1994-1995 school year."

Their family owned a farm that supplied high-quality wood for the manufacture of wands and broomsticks. While shopping for school supplies in Diagon Alley, Rowan met and befriended future fellow student and housemate, Jacob's sibling, to whom Rowan advised starting with Flourish and Blotts. When the shopping concluded, Rowan and Jacob's sibling promised to see each other again on the train. Rowan began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1984 and was Sorted into the same House as Jacob's sibling. Before the start of their first Potions class, Jacob's sibling found Merula Snyde, an imperious and cruel Slytherin witch, trying to bully Rowan into admitting her as the most powerful witch to in Hogwarts. Rowan tried to reason with Merula by listing out other factors, but Merula wouldn't budge, which prompted Jacob's sibling to intervene on Rowan's behalf and stand up for their friend. Later when their Prefect decided to teach Jacob's sibling how to duel, Rowan helped Jacob's sibling find a duelling book in the Artefact Room, where Jacob's sibling saw some visions and heard a mysterious voice saying a kind of ice was here and a vault would open."

There are also human skulls in the room, which Gryffindor House Ghost, Sir Nicholas, alleged was deceased friends of his and former occupants of the castle. It was most notably used by Professor Fortinbras to store clue leading to the research her co-conspirator, Professor Bartholomew, did into the fabled Cursed Vaults, and later when the younger sibling of an expelled student by the name of Jacob retrieved it in their quest to find their brother, after he had run away from home and mysteriously disappeared. To the left of the door, the wall was largely covered by a large wooden cabinet with ten small doors, on top of which stacks of parchments had been stowed away. Just next two it, something that resembled a rolled-up carpet of some kind was leaning against the wall next to a couple of old chalkboards, one of which appeared to have once been used by the Transfiguration department. In the left corner, there was a very large woven basket that holding an assortment of parchment scrolls piled on top of one another, against which there was leaning an obelisk engraved with Egyptian hieroglyphs, and just in front of it, a barrel was lying on its side, holding several small scrolls of parchment. The wall on the far end of the room from the entrance were lined with shelves, most of which are covered by white, dusty draping, underneath which several baskets might be glimpsed. On the lower shelf, there is a human skull wearing pink earmuffs, which supposedly was one of the past acquaintances of the Gryffindor House Ghost. Next to it, there was yet even more scrolls of parchment, two of which were still on the shelf and three that had fallen down onto the floor."

During the First Wizarding War, Augusta's son Frank was both an Auror and a member of the Order of the Phoenix, as was his wife Alice.

 "wandmaker": {
  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wandmaker",
  "summary": "A related occupation was the wandkeeper, though it is unclear whether this was merely another term for wandmaker or a separate occupation. A wandmaker used wood and cores found in the wizarding world to construct a magical instrument to conduct magic through. Wandmakers used a variety of wood and cores based upon their personal research and preference, and used wood and core found in their land. For example, wandmakers in the United States of America used Thunderbird feather and Rougarou hair, but wandmakers in Britain used Phoenix feather and Unicorn hair. The earliest known wandmakers were druids, who thought any plant that had a woody stem could be used in wandmaking. In Britain at least, it was normal for the purchaser of a wand to provide their own core or request something specific, generally a traditional or well-liked substance. A descendant, Garrick Ollivander became a renowed wandmaker and he forsook the concept of witches and wizards procuring their own wand core, because he thought their wands were usually unrefined. He researched the best wand cores and found the best wand wood to complement it, and rather have a purchaser select their wand, he let the wand choose the purchaser."

The physical temperature of the Howler would begin to rapidly increase upon delivery, and it would explode if left unopened for too long. This mechanism ensured that the recipient would open the Howler, even though he or she knew that it contained an unpleasantly loud message. As such, a Howler would convey the displeasure of its author/sender even if left unopened, for it would shower the recipient with insults and cursing upon exploding into flames. The Lovebird to Love Note Transfiguration spell created a note that would verbally convey its message in a manner similar to a Howler, though at a significantly quieter volume. In 1992, Ron Weasley received a Howler from his mother after he stole his father's Flying Ford Anglia. In 1994, Neville received a Howler from his grandmother, after he supposedly misplaced his password list enabling Sirius Black to enter Gryffindor Tower. Also, on that year, Hermione Granger received a few Howlers from readers of Witch Weekly when Rita Skeeter wrote a nasty article on her, claiming she was in a love triangle with Harry Potter and Viktor Krum. Harry Potter's Aunt Petunia received a Howler on 2 August 1995 from Albus Dumbledore, after Vernon Dursley threatened to kick Harry out of their home after two Dementors attacked Harry and his cousin, Dudley in Little Whinging."

At some point between 1 September, 1974 and 31 October, 1981, a student by the name of Jacob became intrigued with and began to search for the fabled Cursed Vaults, five secret rooms of ambiguous origins hidden somewhere inside the castle believed to contain ancient magical treasures older even than the school itself. Although Jacob successfully righted some of his wrongs by getting rid of the cursed ice that had been spreading throughout the school, he was still responsible for these breaches of the castle's security in the first place, not to mention therefore also to blame for all the injuries suffered by fellow students, leading to him being expelled. During this term, the cursed ice had showed up once more: This time in a room on the fifth floor corridor which, unbeknownst to most at the time, was located next door to one of the Cursed Vaults. Having overheard said conversation about the room with cursed ice, Jacob's younger sibling resolved to break in, hoping to find clues as to the location of the Cursed Vaults and by extension, their brother, who had ran away from home following his expulsion was remained missing ever since. Recognising the potential danger she was in, Jacob's sibling and his friends followed her: By the time they reached, the cursed ice, having already reacted to human presence in the room, had encased the Slytherin girl in ice, before the ice covering the floor grew all the way up to the roof, blocking the door through which they all entered. They all made it out of the room uninjured, however, although, as Professor McGonagall said the following year, it was uncertain what kind of damage had been done by their \"ill-advised trip\" into the room with the cursed ice, as it was known to have \"strange effects on students\"."

However, crushing the bean with the flat side of a silver knife was a more simple and effective method of obtaining the juice, as suggested by Severus Snape in his personal copy of Advanced Potion-Making. The suffix \"-phorous\" is more elusive, though it could quite possibly have the same etymological roots as the \"-phorus\" in \"phosphorus\" (a chemical element) - in this case \"phos-\" and \"-phorus\" come from the Greek \u03c6\u03c9\u03c2 (fo\u0331s in the Latin script, meaning light) and \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 (f\u00e9ro\u0331 in the Latin script, meaning bringer or carrier) respectively. Hence, \"Sopophorus\" would read as \"bringer of deep sleep\", which is appropriate given its use as an ingredient in the Draught of Living Death.

At the Hog's Head, customers were charged two sickles per Butterbeer (\u00a30.60 approximately), but it was not certain whether this was a universal price for the drink, or if the price of the drink varied from location to location. It is unclear if these ingredients are required only for the 'Extra Sweet' version, or if these are standard ingredients in normal butterbeer. Another variant of Butterbeer was named Butterbeer 1707, which was considered very rare and could be ordered for delivery. Butterbeer may have had a very slight alcohol content, which could get house-elves in a drunk-like state, though an antidote to this existed. This is likely due to house-elves having both significantly smaller bodies as well as a slightly different body chemistry than humans, thus increasing their vulnerability to the effects of alcohol in any volume. It seemed to have a less pronounced effect on humans than smaller creatures such as house-elves, but humans could still fall \"under the influence\" of it."

As a child, she listened at a keyhole and heard her aunt tell The Warlock's Hairy Heart to her older cousins, as well as parts of a lurid account involving her uncle Nobby, the local hag, and a sack of Bouncing Bulbs. She believed that children are extremely delicate, and that exposure to The Tales of Beedle the Bard harms them, due to what she described as the stories' \"unhealthy preoccupation with the most horrid subjects.\" As such, she reworked several of Beedle's tales, including The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, which became the story of Wee Willykins. However, she was apparently unable to think of a way to tone down The Warlock's Hairy Heart, the story which deeply frightened her as a child, as she never rewrote it. Her work was published in a series of books called The Toadstool Tales, which were universally loathed by children, and were eventually banned because they caused nausea and vomiting (ironically subverting her goal to create suitable tales for children). It may have been chosen in reference to Beatrix Potter, who wrote several classic children's books, including The Tale of Peter Rabbit. The title \"Toadstool Tales\" may also refer to the fact that, in addition to being an author, Beatrix Potter was a mycologist."

The actual gift he received was a Mimbulus mimbletonia, but he said that he could use another Remembrall, because he had lost the old one \"ages ago\"."

Hobart returned home, humiliated, where he realised that his spell could make objects levitate for varying lengths of time, depending on the skill of the spellcaster and on the weight of the object. After realising that the spell was best used on inanimate objects (and small animals, but they do not have any control of their movement once airborne), Hobart made a second announcement, and an even larger crowd gathered to see his second demonstration of the spell (hoping for another laugh at his expense). Hobart's demonstration was, at first, by far more successful than the first one: he showed the onlookers how he could easily levitate objects ranging from small rocks to fallen trees. Hobart decided that, for a finale, we would levitate the Chief Warlock's hat \u2014 what he managed to levitate, however, was the Chief's wig, exposing his bald head to the gathered crowd."

Miranda Goshawk included this charm in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2, the third spell in the book. She also wrote about it in Book of Spells alongside the Shrinking Charm, which could be used to counteract this charm. The Sunday edition of The New York Ghost published on 28 November 1926 had an article about regulators examining the use of this charm for home improvement. Ron Weasley suggested that Rubeus Hagrid might have gotten in the way of a bad Engorgement Charm when he was young, before learning that he was half-giant."

Bagshot presumably lived in the house beginning at least in the late nineteenth century, as she is known to have lived in the town during the 1890s, when her great-nephew Gellert Grindelwald stayed with her briefly. Some time after Bathilda's death in 1997, her home was filled with the odours of old age, dust, unwashed clothes, and stale food. Of these, half-a-dozen of the most large and ornate were missing, likely stolen by Rita Skeeter, who had interviewed a largely senile Bathilda some time before while working on her book, The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. The bedroom contained at least one curtained window, underneath which was a cluttered dressing table and an unmade bed.

Due to long term neglect of his innate talent, Lockhart was not able to cast many spells correctly, but was a master at the use of Memory Charms. In 1992, during his first second year Defence Against the Dark Arts class at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he used his wand in a failed attempt to subdue a batch of highly troublesome Pixies with the nonsense incantation Peskipiksi Pesternomi, after he had foolishly let them loose in the classroom. Later in the year, Lockhart attempted to mend Harry Potter's broken arm bones after they had been broken by a Rogue bludger after a Quidditch match with his wand, with the healing spell Brackium Emendo; however, he performed the spell incorrectly and ended up instead vanishing them completely. During the first and final Duelling Club meeting during the school year, Lockhart was initially disarmed of his wand by Severus Snape after underestimating his duelling abilities in a duelling demonstration. He also tried to show Harry Potter how to block spells, but instead dropped his wand after waving it around flamboyantly. In 1993, Harry Potter disarmed Lockhart of his wand when the latter tried to perform the Memory Charm against him and his friend, Ron Weasley, after they confronted his plan to leave the school and his disclosure of his fraudulence."

It was precipitated when Tom Riddle's Diary, one of Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes, possessed Ginny Weasley and forced her into the Chamber of Secrets. He managed to defeat both the Basilisk and the memory of Tom Riddle, thus saving Ginny's life, and unknowingly eliminating one of Voldemort's Horcruxes. On New Year's Eve, 1926 Tom Riddle was born to the pure-blood witch Merope Gaunt in a London orphanage. Believing death to be the realm of the weak, he initially believed his mother could not have been magical, given her death, and the young Tom focused on finding his father among the records at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After discovering this, he turned his attention to his mother's family and found the Gaunt line, direct descendants of Salazar Slytherin himself leaving near Little Hangleton. Riddle took some time to research his famous ancestor and in his fifth year, he found the fabled Chamber of Secrets. Having come to believe in fanatical pure-blood supremacy, Riddle planned to use the \"terror within\" the chamber to rid the school of those \"unworthy\" to learn magic; that is, Muggle-born wizards and witches."

Neville's pet toad, Trevor, had nothing to commend him except a propensity for getting lost, and when he slipped off to join one day his brethren toads living in the Black Lake, both owner and pet had a sense of relief. Although they do not have magical abilities, they are useful to perform spells on or test potions on, such as when Professor Filius Flitwick made Neville Longbottom's toad, Trevor, fly around his classroom to demonstrate the Levitation Charm in 1991. Toads are particularly useful to potioneers, as the fact that they absorb liquids through their skin allows for easy testing of potions that are normally required to be ingested orally."

 "petrification": {

  "summary": "Petrification was a malign magical state in which a living creature was rendered immobile and unresponsive, as if they had been turned to stone. Petrification could be inflicted by the statue curse, along with the gazes of the Gorgon and the Basilisk. In the case of the Basilisk, its gaze ordinarily killed living creatures, but when seen indirectly, or by a ghost (who was already dead and couldn't die again), it caused Petrification instead. During the history of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Chamber of Secrets was opened twice, and in both cases the Serpent of Slytherin was released and attacked the Muggle-born student body. The first opening in 1943 resulted in the Petrification of three Muggle-born students, and the death of one, Myrtle Warren. The second opening in 1992 led to the Petrification of students Colin Creevey, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hermione Granger and Penelope Clearwater, along with the cat Mrs Norris and the ghost Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington. The antidote to Petrification was the Mandrake Restorative Draught, a highly potent healing potion made from Stewed Mandrakes. The Full Body-Bind Curse was only temporary and could be lifted easily, while the Hardening Charm turned an object to literal stone. Gilderoy Lockhart once confused the effects of Petrification with those of the Transmogrifian Torture; however, the truth of his claims were extremely dubious."

A wooden chair and dresser were located on one side of the bed, near the nightstand. The four poster beds had two shelves at the back of the bed, an owl perch on one side, a small carpet next to the bed and a wooden nightstand at the end of the bed on one side. There was a wooden table in the centre of the dormitory with a stack of books and an hourglass on top of them, an open book with a Self-Writing Quill, parchments and a plant in a flower pot on it.

It was later used by Albus Dumbledore to posthumously ensure that Marvolo Gaunt's ring would be safely delivered to Harry, while at the same time ensuring he could not access the Resurrection Stone set into it until he was ready. Like all Golden Snitches, this Snitch was crafted by a metal charmer, who enchanted the ball with several spells, including giving the Snitch a \"flesh memory\" so it could identify the first human to touch it with their bare skin. During the match, the Snitch was sighted fairly early on by both Harry Potter and Terence Higgs. Harry was almost able to catch it, however, he was fouled by Marcus Flint before he could get close enough, and the Snitch vanished in the confusion. As a result of this, the Snitch acquired the flesh memory of Harry's lips, ensuring that the Snitch would react to him in the future. Sometime prior to his death on 30 June, 1997, Albus Dumbledore assumed that Harry Potter would need the Resurrection Stone set into Marvolo Gaunt's ring at some point in his quest to destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. To remedy this, he obtained this Snitch and cast further spells on it, encasing the ring within the Snitch, and causing two effects to trigger when it recognised Harry's lips. The first, which would activate at any point when Harry placed the Snitch to his lips, would make the Snitch display the inscription \"I open at the close\"."

As with much of Skeeter's writing, though the essence of the article was false, there was smidgen of truth that lent the article an air of believability to those who did not know better. Harry was not Hermione's boyfriend, the two had in fact been close friends since early in their first year at Hogwarts. Additionally, Hermione had danced with Krum at the Yule Ball earlier in the school year and Krum had invited her to visit him over the summer, a fact that Skeeter was only able to learn because she was listening in via her beetle form as an unregistered Animagus. The article also suggested that Hermione might be brewing love potions, something which she likely was in fact quite capable of doing, but would never actually do. The article was, in essence, Skeeter's revenge for Hermione's rallying against her after Skeeter's publication of a previous article regarding Rubeus Hagrid being a half-giant. The article was first brought to the attention of the Trio by Pansy Parkinson, who was laughing about it with a group of friends prior to the start of one of Severus Snape's Potions classes. At first, Hermione was not too bothered by the article, describing it as \"a pile of old rubbish\", but she was bothered by the fact that Rita Skeeter knew certain details that she should not have had any way of knowing. For Hermione, the article was easy to shake off at first, despite Ron's assertion that it made her seem like \"some sort of scarlet woman.\" Deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents, fourteen year old Harry Potter thought that he had found solace in his steady girlfriend at Hogwarts, Muggle-born Hermione Granger."

  "summary": "Scabior (d. 2 May, 1998) was a wizard and a Snatcher in the gang led by Fenrir Greyback during the height of the Second Wizarding War. However, given his intimate knowledge of the interior of the Slytherin common room and its location, he would have attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in his youth and was a member of that house, as only members of that house would possess such detailed knowledge of the common room. At some point in his life Scabior was imprisoned in Azkaban for undisclosed crimes, but was released sometime before or after Lord Voldemort's infiltration of the Ministry of Magic on August 1, 1997. Following his release from Azkaban, Scabior became a Snatcher during the height of the Second Wizarding War, catching Muggle-born wizards and anyone who opposed Voldemort, in return for gold. Several of his victims lied that they were in Slytherin House, but when Scabior asked them where their common room was, none of them could answer. On Greyback's orders, Scabior checked the list of truants, searched the prisoners' tent for Harry's glasses, read a cutting from the Daily Prophet and expressed terrified awe at the thought of summoning Voldemort. Having taken the trio to Malfoy Manor, where Voldemort had set up base, Scabior assured Narcissa Malfoy the prisoner they had caught was Harry Potter. Later, when Bellatrix Lestrange took Godric Gryffindor's Sword from one of the Snatchers, Scabior drew his wand on her but was quickly Stunned. On 2 May, 1998, Scabior participated in the Battle of Hogwarts, leading an army of Snatchers. Scabior nearly ran into the protective enchantments cast by the Hogwarts staff, which killed and disintegrated a number of Snatchers."

Soon after Morfin died in Azkaban, the residence was later used as a hiding place for one of Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes, the ring that he stole from Marvolo. The Muggle village resident Cecilia considered the shack and surrounding area an eyesore compared to the rest of the beautiful land owned by the Riddle family, and wanted it to be cleared away were it not inhabited by the Gaunts. It is unknown if the shack was passed down from descendant to descendant, as the family gold was squandered several generations ago; thus it is possible that the family moved into the shack when their funds ran dry before Marvolo was born. After the deaths of the last three inhabitants, the shack was deserted completely, yet it was not cleared away by the villagers of Little Hangleton."

It was a brilliant red and gold dragon, named for the rounded balls of flame that shot from its nostrils. The Fireball was aggressive but, unlike other dragons, it was more tolerant of its own kind, and will sometimes consent to share its territory with up to two other dragons. The eggs of the Fireball were vivid crimson speckled with gold, and the shells were prized for use in Chinese wizardry. In the 1980s, a Chinese Fireball resided in the Scorched Vale of the Magical Creatures Reserve. A Chinese Fireball was used as one of the obstacles in the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament in 1994, brought to Hogwarts by Charles Weasley. Viktor Krum faced the dragon in an attempt to retrieve a Golden egg it was guarding, and used a Conjunctivitis Curse to temporarily blind the dragon and snatch the golden egg, but it crushed its own eggs and because of that, points were taken off."

The scales of the Swedish Short-Snout were silvery blue, and its powerful flame was also a brilliant blue colour, hot enough to reduce timber and bone to ashes in seconds. Since it rarely came into contact with humans, the Short-Snout has less deaths to its name than most dragons. However, the Short-Snout was a dangerous species due to its agile flying and extremely hot fire."

  "summary": "The Norwegian Ridgeback was a species of dragon that was native to Norway, and its typical habitat was the Northern mountains. In 1802, a Norwegian Ridgeback was reported to have carried off a Whale Calf off the coast of Norway. In 1991, Rubeus Hagrid received a Norwegian Ridgeback egg from a hooded stranger in a pub. After hatching the egg, Hagrid named the creature Norbert, and tried to raise it with the help of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley. However, the dragon was discovered, and eventually Hagrid gave Norbert to Charlie Weasley, who took the young dragon to live with others of its kind in the Romanian Dragon Sanctuary where he worked. By 1997, it was discovered that Norbert was in fact a female dragon, so her name was changed to Norberta. During the 2008\u20132009 school year, Ivy Warrington, another student and a Centaur battled a Norwegian Ridgeback in the Forbidden Forest. During the Calamity which affected the wizarding world during the 2010s, whirlwind Confoundables trapped baby Norwegian Ridgeback Foundables, for which members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force had to overpower with the spell Meteolojinx Recanto. It resembled the Hungarian Horntail, except for the black ridges on its back, the browner texture in its scales, and its less hostile attitude. Its eggs were black, and young Ridgebacks developed the ability to shoot flame earlier than any other breeds (around one to three months). Norwegian Ridgeback is likely a play on Rhodesian Ridgeback, a South African hunting dog used, among other things, to hunt lions."

Dragon mothers were very protective of their eggs, as was found out in the Triwizard Tournament when Harry Potter's Hungarian Horntail violently tried to stop Harry from capturing the Golden egg, thinking it was one of her real eggs. In Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts, Hagrid won a dragon's egg off a stranger he met down at the Hog's Head pub in Hogsmeade. In 1994, as part of the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament at Hogwarts, the Triwizard Champions each had to retrieve a golden replica of a dragon's egg from a female dragon, with the dragon seeking to protect the replica egg among her own actual eggs. Viktor Krum was penalised for having used the Conjunctivitis Curse on his dragon (a Chinese Fireball), which caused the dragon to smash her own eggs due her eyesight being damaged with the curse. During the 1995\u20131996 school year at Hogwarts, the portrait of Giffard Abbott required students use the password \"dragon's egg\" in order to use his secret passageway in the castle. While drunk, they began swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs and Harry Potter used the conversation as cover to refill the wine using the Refilling Charm without being noticed. During the Calamity which affected the wizarding world in the 2010s, dragon eggs were some of the numerous magical items and artefacts which were mysteriously scattered across the world as Foundables, guarding by Confoundables, which had to overpowered by volunteer wizards and witches of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force to return the Foundables to their rightful place."

  "summary": "In the Harry Potter series, the story is relayed to the audience via an extradiegetic narrator, a detached third-person observer close to the action, but in no point involved in it (heterodiegetic). At several points in the books, there are also intradiegetic (either autodiegetic or homodiegetic) narrators for a brief period, such as Bartemius Crouch Jr in part of the thirty-fifth chapter of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Veritaserum), or Rubeus Hagrid in part of the twentieth chapter of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Hagrid's Tale). In the most common official audiobooks of the Harry Potter series, the narrator's voice is that of Stephen Fry (British-English speaking countries) or Jim Dale (U.S.). This character is almost always Harry Potter, although there are moments in which this focalisation changes: Vernon Dursley (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, chapter one), Albus Dumbledore (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, chapter one), Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, chapter eleven), Frank Bryce (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, chapter one), the Prime Minister (Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, chapter one). There are times, however, like in chapter two of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, or in chapter one of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, where the narrator is uncharacteristically objective, and does not relay anything more than facts about the scene before them \u2014 they become a third-person observant narrator."

The youngest of the three brothers, Ignotus was also described as the humblest and wisest of them, and had survived Death's cunning schemes due to these traits. He was born into the Peverell family on 12 July, 1214 in the village of Godric's Hollow in the English West Country, a younger brother to Antioch and Cadmus. Being knowledgeable in the magical arts, it is unknown whether the Peverell brothers attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, were home-schooled or learned about the magical arts on their own, autodidactically. According to Beedle the Bard in his work The Tale of the Three Brothers, Ignotus was the humblest and wisest of the three Peverell brothers. When the three brothers managed to cheat Death while travelling along a \"lonely, winding road at twilight\", Death pretended to congratulate them on their magic and presented them with a gift of their choice. Ignotus's two older brothers met terrible fates due to the murderous lust the Elder Wand created in wizards, and the limitations of the Resurrection Stone. It should be noted, however, that Beedle the Bard most likely employed artistic licence as some aspects of his story seem not to match actual aspects of the Peverells' lives (e.g. the story heavily implies that Cadmus Peverell killed himself before having descendants, when in actuality he was a direct ancestor to the House of Gaunt) and, as such, it should not be taken as an accurate account of the historical facts. As Albus Dumbledore himself theorised, it is much more likely that the Peverell brothers, as gifted wizards, managed to create the Deathly Hallows by themselves."

The Party included a candlelit dinner of rancid, moulded food, the smell of which would gag a normal living human. After this point, Nick returned as a ghost due to his fear of death and presumably held a deathday party every year for five centuries to mark the anniversary of the day he died. In honour of the event, Sir Nicholas took the liberty of decorating one of the castle's roomier dungeons with black candles, which gave off a bluish glow and many black hangings. He also ordered a variety of food that had been tainted to make it stronger, and therefore more likely to be possible for ghosts to taste. This food included large, rotten fish on handsome silver platters, cakes burned charcoal-black, heaped on salvers, maggoty haggis, mouldy cheese, and, in pride of place, an enormous grey cake in the shape of a tombstone, which had his name and date of death written on it in tar-like frosting.

  "summary": "Some time before 1984, a Hogwarts student named Jacob entered the Forbidden Forest searching for a Cursed Vault hidden somewhere in the forest. However, Jacob stole the arrow by magic, leading to Torvus's exile from the herd. During the 1987\u20131988 school year, Jacob's younger sibling came to the forest, also seeking the Vault. Despite his initial distrust, Torvus was happy when Jacob's sibling returned the arrow to him, as it would mean that the rest of the heard would accept him back after a certain number of tasks. In gratitude, he helped Jacob's sibling find and enter the Forest Vault, allowing the student to break the sleepwalking curse that afflicted the students that year. Later that year, the effects from the curse, and the aggressive way Jacob's sibling had dealt with forest creatures who had threatened them, had upset the balance of the forest. Notably, an individual Forest Troll who had a taste for Bubotubers began foraging for them near the Forest Lake where the centaur herd drew their water. The Troll aggressively drove off any one who came near it, denying the Centaurs their water source and setting up a conflict."

  "summary": "Professor Bathilda Bagshot (d. 1997) was a British witch, magical historian and the author of A History of Magic and approximately ten other books. She lived in Godric's Hollow, and was murdered around December, 1997, after which her corpse was animated by Lord Voldemort to contain his pet snake Nagini. Bathilda was also the great-aunt of Gellert Grindelwald, the infamous Dark Wizard who was defeated by Albus Dumbledore. In the 1890s, Bagshot was already an adult living in her house in Godric's Hollow, when Kendra Dumbledore moved there from Mould-on-the-Wold along with her young children Albus, Aberforth, and Ariana, after her husband Percival's well-publicised arrest and imprisonment in Azkaban. Within the next several years, Bathilda sent an owl to Albus Dumbledore, then a Hogwarts student, having been favourably impressed by his paper on trans-species Transfiguration for the scholarly journal Transfiguration Today. At the time of Kendra's death, Bathilda was the only person in Godric's Hollow who was on speaking terms with her. In the summer of 1899, after Albus Dumbledore graduated from Hogwarts, an orphan and head of the family, Bathilda's great-nephew, Gellert Grindelwald, came to live with her and she made a point of introducing Grindelwald to Albus. It is unknown how much or what Bathilda knew of her nephew's actions concerning Aberforth and Ariana Dumbledore, but she witnessed the fist-fight that broke out between the Dumbledore brothers at Ariana's funeral. In 1947, Bathilda's work on wizarding history was published under the title A History of Magic by Little Red Books."

  "summary": "Wright appears in the first film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, only in a small scene set at London King Cross Station, where her character and her mother Molly meet Harry Potter as four of her older brothers board the Hogwarts express. Her role became much more prominent in the second film, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, in which her character begins studies at Hogwarts and encounters a secret diary that begins to control her actions. She also opened the titular chamber in the same film under the influence of Tom Riddle, the main antagonist of the Harry Potter series. Wright's was seen in the third film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban chatting with Hermione in one background and had few dialogues. However, her character had a bonafide supporting role in the fourth film, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, with dialogue sprinkled across several scenes and perhaps her most screen-time yet. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Wright as Ginny played a central role, with hints of Ginny's greater importance to the overall plot by joining Dumbledore's Army and eventually participating in the climactic battle between the DA and the Order of the Phoenix with Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Finally, in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Parts 1 and 2 Wright reprised her central role of Ginny Weasley for the last time, particularly in scenes before Harry, Ron, and Hermione set out on their quest to find the Horcruxes and destroy Voldemort in Part 1 and in Part 2, in the Battle of Hogwarts, and the 19 years later scene as Harry Potter's wife and mother of their three children."

  "summary": "The Fountain of Fair Fortune was one of the stories in the wizarding fairy tales collection, The Tales of Beedle the Bard. Lucius Malfoy, one of the Hogwarts school governors as well as a pure-blood supremacist, once attempted to have the story censored because it depicted a marriage between the witch Amata and the Muggle Sir Luckless, which was utterly disagreeable to those wizards who were strongly prejudiced against Muggles. Dumbledore admitted that this was the beginning of the ongoing feud through which Lucius arduously campaigned to have Dumbledore removed as Headmaster, and Dumbledore, no less arduously, campaigned to have Lucius removed from the Board of Governors. The Fountain of Fair Fortune is one of the most popular tales in the collection, and was the subject of the first and only attempt at putting on a Hogwarts school play, which was ruined due to several factors, including the stage and some of the hall being engulfed in flames from an Ashwinder's eggs and a duel breaking out between two of the cast. Once a year, an \"unfortunate\" is allowed the opportunity to find their way to the Fountain, to bathe in the water, and win \"fair fortune forever more\". Knowing that this may be the only chance to truly turn their lives around, people (with magical powers and without) travel from the far reaches of the kingdom to try and gain entrance to the garden. First is Asha, \"sick of a malady no Healer... could cure\", who hopes the Fountain can restore her health. The third witch, Amata, was deserted by her beloved, and hopes the Fountain will help cure her \"grief and longing\". The witches decide that three heads are better than one, and they pool their efforts to reach the Fountain together. At first light, a crack in the wall appears and \"Creepers\" from the garden reach through and wrap themselves around Asha, the first witch."

The Ashwinder eggs were extremely hot and flammable, and, if not frozen in time, would light fire to the surrounding area. Some enlarged Ashwinder eggs played a large part in the ending of the Hogwarts school pantomime tradition. The Ashwinder was enlarged with the use of an Engorgement Charm; however things got out of control, and the Ashwinder laid its eggs. These eggs, presumed to be enlarged like the Ashwinder, set fire to the floorboards in the Great Hall and ended the Hogwarts pantomime tradition. On 7 December 1926, Newton Scamander attempted to pay Gnarlak with a frozen ashwinder egg for information about his missing beasts. During the Calamity, which happened across the Wizarding world in the 2010s, wizards and witches who worked as volunteers for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force often collected and used these eggs, as ingredients for various potions brewed to help address the mysterious situation."

  "summary": "It took place on a stormy night on 30 May 1927, in the skies and surrounding area of New York City, New York, USA, as the International Confederation of Wizards prepared Grindelwald's extradition to Europe. On 30 May 1927, International Confederation of Wizards sanctioned Gellert Grindelwald's extradition to take place and Grindelwald was supposed to be transported from MACUSA's prison to\u00a0Europe\u00a0in and Incarceration Carriage by\u00a0Rudolph Spielman\u00a0and\u00a0Aurors, to\u00a0be put on trial for the crimes he committed in Europe. Prior to the move, due to Grindelwald's gift of persuasion, he had his tongue cut out, as several guards had sided with him. Meanwhile, Grindelwald was loaded inside the Thestral carriage with Spielman and two guards, with his hands bound behind his back. At the last minute, Abernathy also showed up with a case supposedly containing Grindelwald's wand, claiming the wand was found during a search. At President Picquery's prompting, Abernathy also revealed a silver vial on a chain, and said that it was also found in the search. Unbeknownst to the guards and the MACUSA President, Grindelwald and Abernathy had managed to use human transfiguration and switch appearances. When the carriage with the false Grindelwald set off, Grindelwald, still disguised as Abernathy, disapparates from the MACUSA platform and apparates underneath the carriage, using the Elder Wand."

  "summary": "Dog (subspecies name Canis lupus familiaris) also known as hound is a subspecies of the grey wolf (Canis lupus), a member of the Canidae family of the mammilian order Carnivora. While most normal dogs are generally considered harmless, save those that have been trained or bred for aggressive behaviour, some dogs like the three-headed dog Fluffy are highly dangerous. In the wizarding world, dogs are kept as pets or may sometimes serve as guardians of certain objects. For example, during the 1991\u20131992 school year at Hogwarts, the three-headed dog Fluffy guarded the Philosopher's Stone. There are also magical subtypes of dogs, such as three-headed dogs, Gytrash and Grim. Also, Ron Weasley's Patronus took the form of a Jack Russell Terrier, a breed of hunting dog common in Great Britain and Ireland. The Crup is a type of wizard-bred dog that resembles a Jack Russell Terrier, but possesses a forked tail and is loyal only to wizards, and is highly aggressive towards Muggles and Squibs."

While situated in the home used as headquarters, Vinda watched as Gellert Grindelwald used his skull-hookah to show them Credence Barebone's Obscurus, explaining that Barebone was the \"only known entity alive that could kill Albus Dumbledore\". When Queenie informed her she intended to leave so she could see her sister Tina, Vinda confessed she was deeply committed to Grindelwald, their host, and he entered the room and implored Goldstein to join him. Vinda listened in on a conversation between Nagini and Credence Barebone about pure-blood hatred towards people like them, while leaning on a wall. She went onstage to give Grindelwald a skull hookah to show everyone visions of the violence, warfare and bloodshed of the non-magical people, more specifically visions of the future Second World War. After a young witch with red hair was killed by an Auror after she tried to attack him, Grindelwald in response to the Aurors' opposition to him, conjured a circle of protective fire around himself to test the loyalty of his followers; she stepped into the blue flames unaffected and unharmed, as she was truly loyal to him and his cause. Whilst still holding Grindelwald's skull hookah, Leta Lestrange destroyed it with a powerful spell, which caused it to explode, knocking Rosier backwards."

The diadem remained hidden for several centuries, until Tom Marvolo Riddle discovered that Helena was the Grey Lady, the House Ghost of Ravenclaw, and managed to get the information about its resting place from her. Following his downfall in 1981, Tom Riddle, now known as Lord Voldemort, fled to the forests in Albania in his weakened state. In 1991, he encountered Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry's Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Quirrell, who was looking for him, so that he could at the very least try to capture him or at best learn from him. However, Quirrell overestimated himself, and Voldemort completely overpowered the man, thus leaving Albania and back to London. Following his failed attempt to steal the Philosopher's Stone, Voldemort returned to Albania, weaker than ever. Voldemort also broke the mind of Bertha Jorkins in Albania after she ran into Pettigrew at a wayside inn, learning of the Triwizard Tournament and setting into motion a plan to kill Harry Potter and return to full vitality. Having extracted Bertha for all the information she can provide, Voldemort killed her in Albania. It is possible that Albanian wizards and witches had the option to attend Durmstrang Institute as it accepted students from all over Northern and Eastern Europe, as long as they were of wizarding heritage."

 "golpalotts third law": {

  "summary": "Golpalott's Third Law was a law for making antidotes, which appeared to say that the antidote for a blended poison \u2014 that is, a poison created by mixing several other poisons together \u2014 could not simply be created by finding the antidotes to each separate poison in the blended whole and mixing them together. Instead, as Professor Slughorn explained, the potion maker had to find that single ingredient which, when added to the blended antidotes, transformed them near-alchemically into a combined whole which will counteract the entire blended poison. It is likely that this law is correct for just some poisons, as Professor Slughorn once asked his class to consider the law's validity. Creating an antidote following this law may be quite difficult--in the Potions class during which Professor Slughorn asked the class to make antidotes according to Golpalott's Third Law, Hermione Granger made an only half-finished antidote that included fifty-two ingredients, one of them being a chunk of her own hair. At Hogwarts, sixth year students studying N.E.W.T.-level Potions class learn to produce antidotes referring to this law, under the instructions of their Potions Master."

In 1991, Severus Snape asked Harry Potter where one would to find a bezoar in Harry's first ever Potions class, in order for him to chastise Potter for supposedly not paying attention during his class. In 1994, in a Potions exam, Harry forgot to add a bezoar to his potion, because he was too focused on thinking about asking Cho Chang to the Yule Ball,\u00a0which\u00a0subseqeuntly earned him bottom marks in this class for his dismal performance. As a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Severus Snape, under his alias \"The Half Blood Prince\", wrote \"Just shove a bezoar down their throats.\" During the 1996-1997 school year, during one of Harry's sixth year N.E.W.T. class about antidotes, Harry, who was unable to understand Golpalott's Third Law, fetched a bezoar from the cupboard and showed it to Professor Horace Slughorn as the answer to the poison he was supposed to be analysing. Harry, remembering the above mentioned incident in Potions class, quickly found the bezoar he had given Professor Slughorn and shoved it down Ron's throat, saving his life. Bezoars are undigested clumps of matter that accumulate inside a digestive system, similar to a cat's hairballs."

In the evening of 1 May, 1998, Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Granger returned to the Death Eater-controlled Hogwarts Castle seeking one of Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes, which they believed to be an object that once belonged to Rowena Ravenclaw. Harry and his friends entered the Room of Requirement, where he found many students (mostly former Dumbledore's Army members) hiding so as to avoid the Carrow siblings, two Death Eaters teaching at Hogwarts known for their brutality and cruel, sadistic punishments on wrongdoing students. Believing the Horcrux to be a Ravenclaw-related object, and knowing that the only object known to have belonged to Ravenclaw was the Diadem of Ravenclaw, Harry Potter (accompanied by Luna Lovegood) decided to go to Ravenclaw Tower to get an idea of what the diadem looked like, as there was a model of it on a statue in the common room. They entered the common room, but Alecto Carrow caught them and pressed her Dark Mark with her finger, thus sending the warning to Lord Voldemort and the other Death Eaters that Harry Potter was in the Castle. Upon discovering his sister unconscious on the floor and no sign of Harry Potter (he and Luna were under the Invisibility Cloak), Amycus panicked as he thought of Voldemort's fury at it being a false alarm. Amycus then came up with a plan to blame Alecto's summoning of Voldemort to the castle on the Ravenclaw students, and McGonagall flatly told him blaming the two Death Eaters' failures on the students of Hogwarts was out of the question; she refused to allow him to lie and thus have the children punished by Voldemort."

The venom's potency was apparently extremely long-lasting, as Hermione Granger was able to use the venom from the fang of a Basilisk that was dead for nearly five years. In 1993, Harry Potter stabbed the roof of the basilisk's mouth with Godric Gryffindor's Sword and ended up getting a fang splintered into his arm. Tom Riddle described the venom as being able to kill Harry in a little more than a minute, though Fawkes's tears healed Harry's arm and cleansed the poison. After being healed, Harry took the fang and stabbed Riddle's diary, destroying that Horcrux beyond magical repair. Because Harry had stabbed the Basilisk with the sword, it was imbued with Basilisk venom and was therefore able to destroy Horcruxes and poison opponents that it cuts through as well. Albus Dumbledore used Gryffindor's Sword, which has been imbued with the basilisk's venom three years prior, to destroy Marvolo Gaunt's Ring. In 1998, during the Battle of Hogwarts, Ron and Hermione went down to the Chamber of Secrets and destroyed Helga Hufflepuff's Cup with a basilisk fang."

While the pub was, from the first, a place for witches and wizards to congregate\u2014 whether Londoners or out-of-towners up for the day to shop for the latest magical ingredients or devices\u2014Muggles were not turned away or made to feel unwelcome, even though some of the conversations, not to mention pets, caused many an unwary Muggle to leave without finishing his or her mead. With the imposition of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy in 1692, Minister Ulick Gamp permitted the pub to continue its existence as a safe haven and refuge for members of the magical community. Though insistent on numerous concealment spells and good behaviour from all who used the pub, Gamp was sympathetic to the need of wizards to let off steam during this difficult time, and further agreed to give the landlord permission to let people into Diagon Alley from his backyard, because the shops behind the Leaky Cauldron were now also in need of protection. Out of gratitude, the landlord created a new brand of beer, Gamp's Old Gregarious, which tasted so disgusting that even with a one-hundred-Galleon incentive, nobody could finish a pint. In 1887, the pub was faced with the possibility of being demolished when the Muggles set in motion the construction of Charing Cross Road."

They did this in order to appease Peeves, so he would give them the Vault portrait in exchange for unleashing various forms of chaos upon the school. During the 1990\u20131991 school year, a wizard called Olivier Kikkert was a frog Animagus who was arrested for robbery, and was placed on trial in the Wizengamot of the British Ministry of Magic for his crimes. During the summer holidays of 1994, when Harry Potter visited The Burrow, a fish tank on the windowsill that had previously held frog spawn, held instead a single extremely large frog. In early August 1995, Hedwig caught a dead frog and brought it home, but Harry Potter asked her to leave off it, as he had work for her. In 1992, some third years accidentally plastered frog brain all over the ceiling in Dungeon Five. Despite this group's name, they actually used toads instead of frogs (although toads are a species of frog)."

  "summary": "Rabbits (or, colloquially, Bunnies) are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha, found in several parts of the world. There are eight different genera in the family classified as rabbits, including the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), cottontail rabbits (genus Sylvilagus; 13 species), and the Amami rabbit (Pentalagus furnessi, an endangered species on Amami \u014cshima, Japan). There are many other species of rabbit, and these, along with pikas and hares, make up the order Lagomorpha. Rabbits, if needed to be dispatched by magic, are particularly vulnerable to Vermillious, as well as the Fire-making spell. If Conjuration was not performed correctly, mistakes such as Frog-Rabbit hybrids could occur, explainable by the Principle of Artificianimate Quasi-Dominance. The Fat Friar was executed by senior churchmen, in part because they were suspicious of his habit of pulling rabbits out of the communion cup, sometime during the Middle Ages. Shortly after the disappearance of French sorceress Lisette de Lapin in 1422, a large white rabbit was seen crossing the English Channel in a cauldron with a sail fitted to it, and a similar rabbit later became a trusted advisor at the court of King Henry VI. In a 1913 Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson concerning Boggarts at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, an unidentified student used the Boggart-Banishing Spell to turn a Vampire Boggart into a buck-toothed rabbit. In the 1930s, a young Tom Riddle, killed the pet rabbit of another boy, Billy Stubbs, after Stubbs had insulted him, and hung it from the rafters of the building of Wool's Orphanage where they lived."

He was very old by the time Harry Potter knew him, as he was mentioned by Dumbledore in the late 1930s to Tom Riddle. Tom was likely a pupil at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and studied there from the age of\u00a0eleven until he left, and eventually became barman/landlord of the Leaky Cauldron some time before 1938. It is possible that Tom encountered Tom Marvolo Riddle (later to be known as Lord Voldemort) on his way to Diagon Alley for the first time, as Albus Dumbledore had told Tom Riddle to ask for him to get there. During the 1990\u20131991 school year, a wizard went to the Leaky Cauldron to chat with Tom when the wizard saw the Muggle Artefact Smuggler. In 1991, when Harry Potter and Rubeus Hagrid passed through the Leaky Cauldron on their way to Diagon Alley, Tom greeted Hagrid like an old friend, or, at the very least, a regular. Other witches and wizards who were there at the time (including Doris Crockford, Dedalus Diggle, and Quirinus Quirrell) began introducing themselves to Harry, before Hagrid managed to get him away from all of them. In 1993, Cornelius Fudge (then Minister for Magic) asked Tom to keep an eye on Harry Potter while Sirius Black was on the loose until he was due to return to Hogwarts. In 1996, the Leaky Cauldron pub was almost completely empty, aside from Tom and Rubeus Hagrid, who greeted Harry Potter when he arrived there. Tom and Harry acknowledged each other, but did not have time to speak, as Harry was busy on Hogwarts business, with Tom gloomily returning to wipe glasses."

In the middle of the battle, after Harry witnessed the death of Severus Snape in the Shrieking Shack, he took a flask of Snape's memories to Albus Dumbledore's Pensieve and viewed them. After seeing memories covering years of the professor's life, Harry realised that Snape was a loyal member of the Order of the Phoenix, and he himself was a Horcrux. In the remains of the Forbidden Forest Acromantula colony, he found Lord Voldemort and allowed himself to be hit with the Killing Curse, destroying the Horcrux that was Harry. After the hour-long armistice during the Battle of Hogwarts, Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters took Harry Potter's believed \"dead body\" to the Castle to announce their victory. However, the arrival of the Hogwarts centaur herd, Grawp and the families and friends of the Hogwarts students that had stayed to fight as well as the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade made the battle restart as the fighters ran into the Entrance Hall to avoid Grawp, who had started fighting with Voldemort's giants. Neville Longbottom beheaded Nagini, Voldemort's last Horcrux with Godric Gryffindor's Sword, thus rendering him mortal once again. Harry Potter discreetly took his Invisibility Cloak and joined the fight, that was moving to the Great Hall through the Entrance Hall, while concealed."

When Dolores was fifteen, Orford and Ellen separated and Orford took their daughter to live with him while Ellen took their son and disappeared into the Muggle world. He was so despised by his own daughter that by the time Dolores was promoted to the head of the Improper Use of Magic Office, she was able to persuade him to take an early retirement. Whenever people asked her if she is related to the Umbridge who used to mop floors in the Ministry, she would use her sweetest smile (which indicates her suppressed rage) to deny all connections, and falsely claimed that her deceased father was an esteemed member of the Wizengamot. Nasty things tend to happen to people who ask about Orford, or anything else Dolores did not want to talk about, so people who wished to be on her good side would pretend to believe her false heritage. Whether or not Dolores kept her promise with her father in the small allowance is unknown, but she wanted to sever all ties with him to give herself a better image; the two clearly have little to no contact as a result. With Dolores arrested for her crimes involving the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, Orford definitely lost his pittance (assuming he was still alive at the time). Orford was an unambitious man who was content with his career as a janitor, mostly mopping floors in the Ministry of Magic. He seemed to be unaware or tolerant of how his daughter would deny any connections with him, as she would falsely claim her father has died as a distinguished member of the Wizengamot."

He also reached the American public with films such as Yanks (1979, John Schlesinger). More recognised then, Harris acted in widespread movies in the early 1980s, particularly the alien prince Thun in Flash Gordon (1980, Mike Hodges, also featuring Robbie Coltrane); colonel Bobi in The Dogs of War (1981, John Irvin, also featuring Jim Broadbent); a little role as band leader in Ragtime (1981, Milos Forman, also featuring Richard Griffiths); and the smuggler captain Simon Katanga in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981, Steven Spielberg, music by John Williams). During this time, Harris also played the first coloured detective of Great Britain's TV, Winston Churchill Wolcott, top-billing in the 1981 mini-series Wolcott, and he also worked along Miranda Richardson in 1985 theatre adaptation of David Mamet's Edmond in Newcastle. He was a recurrent character in the first season of BBC's TV drama Casualty (1986), to which he would return in a different role for a single episode 18 years later (This series also featured a pre-chamber of secrets Gemma Padley in a different episode). Harris then continued his career in the Royal National Theatre/Lyttleton: He performed as De Flores in The Changeling, by Thomas Middleton and William Rowley in 1988, and then acted in Mountain Language, written and directed by Harold Pinter, and a collaboration he would reprise for BBC ten years later."

When they crashed the car into the Whomping Willow, McGonagall made sandwiches and pumpkin juice appear on Snape's desk in his office. Later that year, after Harry Potter had injured himself during a game of Quidditch and ended up in the Hospital Wing as a result, his friends brought him various sweet treats, including bottles of pumpkin juice. In 1995, Severus Snape threatened to put some Veritaserum in Harry Potter's evening pumpkin juice to get the truth when he thought he was stealing Polyjuice Potion ingredients. However, it was actually Bartemius Crouch Junior, disguised as Alastor Moody with Polyjuice Potion, getting ingredients to keep his identity a secret. This explained why Bartemius Crouch Junior, disguised as Alastor Moody with Polyjuice Potion, had ignored his flagon of pumpkin juice at the first-night feast and drank from a flask instead \u2014 he wasn't just afraid of being poisoned like the real Moody would of, but needed to keep drinking the potion."

In 1996, during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Neville temporarily used Hermione's wand after his wand was broken, and Hermione was incapacitated by Death Eater Antonin Dolohov. At one point in the battle, when Walden Macnair grabbed Harry by the throat, Neville jabbed him in the eye through his mask with Hermione's wand, making him scream and release Harry. After the battle, Neville returned Hermione's wand to her and purchased a new wand for himself. When the trio infiltrated the British Ministry of Magic to steal back Slytherin's locket from Dolores Umbridge, Hermione used her wand for the mission. In December 1997, Hermione had to share her wand with Harry for a time after his wand was broken by the Blasting Curse she used to defend him from Nagini when the snake attacked them in Godric's Hollow."

Xenophilius, after informing the trio about the legend of the Deathly Hallows, tried to turn them over to the Death Eaters in order to get back his abducted daughter. After Harry Potter and Hermione Granger were attacked at Godric's Hollow on Christmas Eve, they became aware of a connection between Albus Dumbledore, Gellert Grindelwald, Godric's Hollow, and a symbol in The Tales of Beedle the Bard. The same symbol had been found on the grave of Ignotus Peverell in Godric\u2019s Hollow, and had been worn by Xenophilius Lovegood at the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour. Hermione thought that Dumbledore may have wanted them to figure out the connection, as he had left the book to her in his will and they were at a loss as to where to find the other Horcruxes or what the symbol meant. Although Harry was sceptical, Ron Weasley \u2014 who had just returned to his friends using the Deluminator Dumbledore left him, and destroyed the locket Horcrux \u2014 agreed with Hermione, partly because she was still furious with him for leaving and he wanted to get back on her good side. Thus, the trio headed for the Lovegood House to question Xenophilius, though they were also eager to see Luna. His magazine The Quibbler, along with the radio programme Potterwatch, were the only media outlets telling the truth about the atrocities being committed under Lord Voldemort\u2019s regime and advocating support of Harry and the Order of the Phoenix. Hermione pointed out the Erumpent horn in the Lovegoods\u2019 living room, as they are combustible and dangerous items to have. When they prompted him to get Luna Lovegood, he wandered off saying he would \u2013 but in fact called Death Eaters at the Ministry of Magic with the news that Harry Potter was in his home."

It is also unknown what quantity of heartstrings could be collected from each dragon's heart. Dragon heartstrings produced wands with the most magical power, and which were capable of the most flamboyant spells. The dragon wand tended to be easiest to turn to the Dark Arts, though it would not incline that way of its own accord. The wandmaker Garrick Ollivander was known to use dragon heartstrings as one of his three cores; the others being unicorn hairs and phoenix feathers. Gregorovitch also used dragon heartstring in his wands, such as the one he made for Viktor Krum."

This campaign was put into place when Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge denied the Dark Lord's return, a fact that would ruin the thirteen years of peace that the Ministry had worked so hard to build and maintain. This campaign had a highly negative effect; as the majority of the wizarding world began to believe Harry and Dumbledore over Fudge, once Voldemort was revealed to have returned, the entire wizarding community not only lost complete trust and respect for Fudge, but also confidence in the Ministry of Magic itself; as a result, Fudge was removed from office as Minister for Magic by force. Due to paranoia, Fudge believed that Dumbledore was trying to usurp his position of Minister for Magic, and not only used the Daily Prophet to make it look as though Dumbledore and Potter were liars and \"nutters,\" but also stripped Dumbledore of many of his titles and statuses: Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, the Order of Merlin, and eventually the Headmastership of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry, for supporting Dumbledore and being the one who claimed Voldemort returned, also suffered from this campaign. Due to the great influence the Ministry had, the majority of the wizarding community ceased supporting Dumbledore and Harry and lost a chance to prepare themselves against Voldemort. These incidents continued throughout the following months and included the casting of the Dark Mark at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup, the scuffle at the home of Alastor Moody, and the mysterious illness and disappearance of Bartemius Crouch Senior - incidents that all culminated to the events of 24 June, 1995."

Gifford Abbott was part of the Abbott family, which was one of the pure-blood families listed in the Sacred Twenty-Eight directory in the 1930s. However, Giffard's actual blood status was unknown and may have been a half-blood individual within the pure-blood family, like some Malfoys, or a muggle-born wizard born into the family after the 1930s. In early 1993, Giffard had a portrait of himself at the Grand Staircase, hung immediately below the first-floor landing. As it was placed in an inaccessible place, it is unlikely he guarded any shortcut to another part of the school. One of his portraits was hanging at the Grand Staircase, guarding the shortcut to the Transfiguration Courtyard, under the password \"Dragon's Egg\". When Abbott informed Harry Potter that he would need to ask a Hufflepuff student for the password in order to use his shortcut, Harry Potter had no difficulty doing this, as most Hufflepuffs had immense respect for him due to his loyalty to the late Cedric Diggory during the Triwizard Tournament. There was another set of portraits of him, hiding another hidden passageway between the Clock Tower and the corridor outside the Library; the password needed to gain access to this shortcut was \"Tempus neminem manet\". Giffard's portrait was moved to another landing of the Grand Staircase, during the next school year."

  "summary": "Acne is an infection of the skin, caused by changes in the sebaceous glands which usually happen during puberty. Acne is also a part of a Mandrake's maturing cycle; once their acne has cleared up they are ready for repotting and after that reach maturity. Eloise Midgen was known to have a bad case of acne and many of her colleagues at Hogwarts School used her as the standard against which really bad acne was to be measured. The effects of the Dumbledore's Army parchment jinx were stated in a generalised manner to make severe acne \"look like a couple of cute freckles\"."

Most of them hung around Draco Malfoy, the son of a well-known Death Eater and wealthy pure-blood, Lucius Malfoy. That may be the reason they knew each other so well, seeing as Draco made friends with them shortly after meeting in their first year at Hogwarts. Draco and his gang frequently antagonised Harry Potter and his friends, and Malfoy also used his position as prefect to bully some first years when he got the power in his fifth year. The length of their acquaintance prior to that time is unknown, but this was the start of Draco's gang while at Hogwarts. This worsened when Harry was seen in the company of Ronald Weasley (about whom Draco was told by his father that his family were 'blood traitors'), and later was seen with Hermione Granger (who was Muggle-born). Another instance of the gang bullying Harry and Ron, was when Harry was challenged to a duel by Draco, which Harry went to; Draco alerted Argus Filch that he'd overheard people planning to meet at the place where he'd set up the duel, and Filch almost caught Harry and Ron (and Neville Longbottom and Hermione, who'd tagged along). In 1992, Draco Malfoy joined the Slytherin Quidditch team as Seeker (by buying his way in), which led to more bullying of Harry Potter and friends by his gang."

Her best friend Cho Chang considered Hermione's jinx a \"horrible trick\", arguing that Hermione should have at least told everyone that she had jinxed the parchment, but Harry retorted that he thought it was a \"brilliant idea\". Marietta had the marks even the following year, and on the Hogwarts Express Harry smirked when he saw Marietta was wearing a very thick layer of make-up but the pimples were still visible.

  "summary": "Shrouded in mystery and operating largely in complete secrecy, while little was known about its origins and motives, and even though the identities of its members was largely unknown, it was eventually discovered by Alastor Moody that it consisted of a group of Dark Wizards that dealt in the illicit acquisition of arcane knowledge, magical artefacts and unlocking the path to immortality, and whose ruthless pursuit for power had given rise to various clandestine operations around the world. They were also known to have had sufficient political influence to facilitate the continued concealment of their unlawful activities; having at some point successfully infiltrated the Ministry of Magic in London and been able to search for the fabled Cursed Vaults for more than half a decade before the Ministry even received their first reports that their cabal existed; at which point its members had already acquired enough sway to issue commands to the guards at the fortress of Azkaban; having at one point ordered a Dementor to leave its post in Azkaban and attack Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry without being discovered. Two school years later, they wrote to both Jacob's sibling and Patricia Rakepick, telling Rakepick to step aside from Hogwarts. That same year, a mysterious cloaked figure told Jacob's sibling to avoid the Cursed Vaults, Patricia Rakepick and the Forbidden Forest. It is possible that the messenger was a member of, or sent by, R. R later sent a Dementor to Hogwarts to test Jacob's sibling. With the help of Mundungus Fletcher, Jacob's sibling found out in Knockturn Alley (while wearing an invisibility cloak) that the Hogwarts mole was really their long thought-to-be friend Merula Snyde."

 "metamorphmagus": {

  "summary": "Metamorphmagi) was a witch or wizard with the rare magical ability to change their physical appearance through sheer will alone, without the need of Polyjuice Potion, or a spell like most of the wizarding population. Unlike Animagi, Metamorphmagi could take a wide variety of forms, changing gender and age, potentially looking like anyone at all, or even just changing a part of their appearance, such as the colour of their hair or shape of their noses. There also seems to be a degree of heritability, as both Nymphadora Tonks and her son, Teddy Lupin, were Metamorphmagi, although both of Tonks' parents, Andromeda and Ted, were not. The ability presented very early in life, as Teddy Lupin's hair changed colour when he was a newborn infant, as did his mother's. However, Nymphadora Tonks showed that she only needed to concentrate a little to change her appearance, so it may be simply a matter of the Metamorphmagi wanting to change. Whilst it was debated whether Animagi transformations and Disapparition required a wand, it seemed that Metamorphmagi did not need theirs to utilise their abilities. Nymphadora Tonks claimed that other wizards needed a wand or potions to transform, meaning Metamorphmagi such as herself were not restricted as such. It is unknown if Metamorphmagi had to register with the Ministry of Magic like Animagi had to, as Metamorphmagi did not choose to become what they were, while Animagi did. Although unlike Animagi, Metamorphmagi did not possess any distinct markings that come with their transformation, so it would be far more difficult to keep track of them for any signs of ability abuse."

  "summary": "The one he was most well known for, and the first he received, was on his forehead and was shaped like a lightning bolt (possibly the shape of the wand movement required for the killing curse); it was the result of a Killing Curse striking him when he was an infant, and played a role in his conflict with, and eventual defeat of, Lord Voldemort. A scar on Harry Potter's forehead in the shape of a lightning bolt was the result of a failed murder attempt by Lord Voldemort on 31 October 1981, when he struck 15-month-old Harry with the Killing Curse. Unbeknownst to Voldemort, the incident also inadvertently made Harry into a Horcrux, as a piece of the Dark Lord's soul embedded itself in Harry. The scar on Harry's forehead prompted his enemy Draco Malfoy to come up with and use the mocking nickname of \"Scarhead\" for Harry, which he first uttered during the Quidditch match of Gryffindor vs Slytherin in 1992, and used multiple times afterwards too. In the years to come, Harry's scar hurt whenever Voldemort was close, or whenever he was in danger from the Dark Lord or his followers, the Death Eaters, such as when one set off the Dark Mark near him in 1994. At this point, it became clear to Albus Dumbledore and to Harry that the scar was part of a link between his mind and that of Voldemort. It would hurt Harry whenever Voldemort was experiencing strong negative emotions, and sometimes Harry was able to see into Voldemort's thoughts directly. To try to prevent Voldemort from invading Harry's mind, Dumbledore had him take Occlumency lessons with Severus Snape, though they were ultimately unsuccessful, because Snape and Harry could not put their animosity towards each other aside and perform the necessary steps required in teaching and learning this art. In June 1996, Voldemort used the link to send Harry a false vision of his godfather being tortured with the Cruciatus Curse in order to lure him to the Department of Mysteries."

Malfoy and his mother then left the shop in contempt, with Narcissa Malfoy disdainfully telling her she would rather do business with rival tailors Twilfitt and Tattings, because of the \"scum\" that she served, leaving Malkin highly insulted."

Black treacle has a distinctively strong, bitter flavour, and is possessed of a richer colour than its \"golden\" cousin, yet not as dark as molasses. Golden syrup is the main sweetener in treacle tart, a favourite dessert of Harry Potter."

In adulthood, Sage became an accomplished magical historian, specialising in examining magical artefacts and the interpretation of runes. Eventually, he found employment at the British Ministry of Magic, where he was hired by the Ministry's research wing and assigned to the Department of Magical Artefacts, where he would eventually rise to the position of Head Curator. Due to his knowledge on magical creatures, he would also occasionally be called on to assist with the investigations into creature-related incidents by the Beast Division in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Greatly impressed by the man's skill in rune translation and ancient languages, Mr. Bragnam, who decided that he were being wasted with the Aurors, tried to have him transferred to his own department; only to learn, to his dismay, that his wife had already persuaded him to pursue a career as an Unspeakable in the Department of Mysteries. After five prominent members of the magical community in Great Britain went mysteriously missing in 2015, Mr. Bragnam lent his expertise to the efforts being made to find them by joining the council that oversaw the search lead by the Head of the Auror Office, Harry Potter.. After several months without any results, even after the lead Auror on the case had even borrowed creatures from the Magizoologist Mathilda Grimblehawk in the Beast Division, the Ministry came under a lot of pressure to find them. Still and all, it would take at least a couple of years before the Ministry decided to hold a Public Hearing to discuss a motion to terminate the London Five investigation; during which Grim Fawley, the husband of one of the missing individuals; made a stirring speech where he urged the Ministry to keep the investigation open."

If the process was completed correctly and nothing untoward was found, then the broomstick will be returned to its owner in its original, pristine condition. He was delighted by gift, but Hermione Granger was worried that the broom may have been sent by Sirius Black (believed at the time to be in league with Lord Voldemort and out to kill Harry) and reported the gift to Professor Minerva McGonagall. McGonagall, worried as well, confiscated the broomstick and stated that it would be \"stripped down\" by Professor Filius Flitwick and Madam Rolanda Hooch, a process that involved testing it for various jinxes and hexes. Harry, needing the broom for an upcoming Quidditch match, began pestering Professor McGonagall daily for news, until she finally snapped and stated that it had been found to be free of the usual jinxes and hexes, but Flitwick was worried that it might be carrying a Hurling Hex. It was later revealed that the broomstick had in fact been sent to Harry by Sirius Black, but was not jinxed because Sirius was innocent of the crimes of which he had been accused, and had never been after Harry."

After being thoroughly tested (which included stripping it down), the broom was given back to Harry since Professor Flitwick and Madam Hooch found no jinxes, hexes or curses on it. Sirius later admitted to having sent the broom to Harry, calling it \"thirteen birthdays' worth of presents from your godfather.\" Harry made good use of the broom throughout the rest of his time at Hogwarts, riding it during every Quidditch match he played. Though the Firebolt was confiscated for several months during the 1995\u20131996 school year by Dolores Umbridge after she gave Harry a lifetime ban from Quidditch, he regained it after she left the school.

The Ravenclaw Tower required the answer to a riddle in order to enter, and the Hufflepuff Basement required tapping the barrel 'two from the bottom, middle of the second row' in the stack of barrels near the kitchen corridor, in the rhythm of Helga Hufflepuff. It can be said that the methods of gaining entry to each house's common room mirrored the perceived intellectual reputation of each house. Hufflepuff, often known as the house with no certain particular aptitude in its students, had a very simple method of entry that never changed. On the other end of the spectrum, Ravenclaw, a house prizing intelligence, provided a new intellectual challenge with each attempted entry. It was against Hogwarts covenants for parents or professors to enter common areas without specific permission, most likely from the Headmaster."

  "summary": "It was Sirius Black's first attempt to enter Gryffindor Tower and kill Peter Pettigrew, then hiding out as Ron Weasley's pet rat Scabbers, in revenge for the betrayal of James and Lily Potter. After Severus Snape tipped him off to the fact Lord Voldemort had marked them for death, Albus Dumbledore advised James and Lily Potter to go into hiding with their son Harry using the Fidelius Charm, a concealment charm so strong that the only way to break it is for the Secret Keeper, the person to whom the spell is bound, to reveal it to the person by whom the witch or wizard does not want to be found. Dumbledore offered to be the Potters' Secret Keeper due to suspecting, correctly, that one of their friends had betrayed the Order of the Phoenix and joined the Death Eaters as a spy. Unbeknownst to all except the Potters, Sirius convinced James to make Peter Pettigrew, one of their friends, his family's Secret Keeper instead. Making Pettigrew the Secret Keeper proved to be poor judgement on Black's part: Pettigrew was the traitor who joined the Death Eaters, under his Maurauder name Wormtail, as a spy. One week after becoming the Potters' Secret Keeper, Wormtail went to his master and told Voldemort they were in Godric's Hollow, where the Dark Lord met his downfall in Harry Potter. Pettigrew's actions resulted in Sirius to Azkaban by framing him for betraying James and Lily, leading them to their deaths, and the murder of the twelve Muggles whom Wormtail murdered by blowing up the street with a powerful Blasting Curse and faking his own death by Sirius's hands. Twelve years later, Black read an article about the Weasley family in the news and recognised Scabbers as Pettigrew in his Animagus form and escaped from Azkaban using his own Animagus form to hunt him down at Hogwarts (a black dog)."

Before they could contact Voldemort to alert him to their capture of Harry, Bellatrix Lestrange spotted the Sword of Gryffindor among the prisoners' possessions. Bellatrix isolated Hermione for interrogation and ordered that the other prisoners be taken to the dungeons below, where Luna Lovegood and Garrick Ollivander were also being held. While Bellatrix tortured Hermione with repeated use of the Cruciatus Curse, Harry and Ron desperately tried to escape the dungeons.

Bellatrix reported that her wand had been stolen to Gringotts Wizarding Bank, as she feared Harry, Hermione, and Ron would try to break into her vault, which contained an item important to Lord Voldemort. Hermione used the wand during her impersonation of Bellatrix, but found wielding it to be distasteful, since not only did she not win its allegiance, but of the criminal activities associated with it. Harry, who at first thought Hermione was being picky for a wand she had no affinity with, suddenly felt an urge to snap it or even slice it in two with the Sword of Gryffindor as revenge for its victims after Hermione reminded him that it was the wand that killed Sirius.

They tended to beg and plead with more prosperous wizards that gave patronage to the street's establishments, though they were thoroughly ignored, and in many cases abused by Death Eaters and their supporters. Some did not take their persecution lying down however, as one attacked Hermione Granger, who at the time was disguised as Bellatrix Lestrange, in a fit of rage. Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley came across these beggars on their way to Gringotts Wizarding Bank in the spring of 1998. When they spotted Hermione, who was disguised as Bellatrix Lestrange by use of Polyjuice Potion, they turned away and hid.

It was during their stay in the forest that Severus Snape anonymously delivered Godric Gryffindor's Sword to Harry by placing it inside the frozen lake that resides in the forest and using his Patronus, a doe, to guide him to it. As Harry attempted to retrieve the sword from the lake, the locket horcrux around his neck began to strangle him. Fortunately for Harry, Ron Weasley, having previously abandoned his friends, rejoined the group and saved Harry's life.

Later that year, Hagrid happily told the trio that he had a won a dragon egg in a card game at the Hog's Head. Thinking that it was too much of a coincidence that, as Hagrid had always dreamed of owning a dragon, someone just happened to show up at the local pub with a dragon egg, the trio questioned Hagrid about the supposed dragon dealer. Upon finding out that Hagrid had never even seen the man's face, as he wore a hood, yet Hagrid had drunkenly told him how to get past Fluffy, they came to the conclusion that the hooded man must have been Severus Snape, when it was really Quirinus Quirrell."

One witch within the jury stood up and congratulated Bagman for his rather impressive play in the previous Quidditch match, with the others cheering him.

Generally, magical schools were situated in landlocked, mountainous areas, which were difficult to access without magic and easier to defend in case of attack. There were, however, exceptions, such as Mahoutokoro School of Magic located on the island of Minami Iwo Jima, and Castelobruxo in the Amazon rainforest. Correspondence courses were also sometimes used as a cost-effective method of providing magical instruction to young witches and wizards in countries with very small or isolated wizarding populations. Wizarding schools generally admitted students from whatever country in which they were based, but some served multiple nations or a broad geographical region, or at least were open to accepting international students on a selective basis."

Wizards and witches may have had this trait naturally, as displayed by Harry Potter's and Bartemius Crouch Junior's resistance to the Imperius Curse. Magical creatures and beings such as giants and half-giants may also have had the natural ability to resist spells. Giants, dragons, Graphorns and trolls had considerable spell resistance, with hides that repelled all but the most concentrated and powerful spells, although they were still vulnerable to attacks on their eyes such as the Conjunctivitis Curse, possibly owing to the eyes being weak. Quintaped were able to resist Untransfiguration, as both the McClivert clan and the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures tried in failure to turn them back into humans. The further to the right the bar was, the weaker that creature's resistance to that spell. Dragon hide seemed to retain much of its protective power after the creature's death, and so was often made into protective gloves that could protect the wearer from hazards such as burning. Strong mental capabilities were required when resisting some spells, which included resisting the Imperius Curse, the obscure art of Occlumency and non-verbal magic."

On the dais stood the Veil, which was represented as a tall stone pointed archway that looked so ancient, cracked and crumbling that it seemed amazing that it was still standing (especially as it was not supported by any surrounding wall), and the archway was hung with the Veil; which appeared as a tattered black curtain, gently fluttering and swaying very slightly \"as though it had just been touched\" (perhaps due to the souls of the dying passing unseen into the next life through it). Communication through the Veil appeared to be impossible, though when a living person approached it, the souls of the dead, recognising a loved one nearby, would try to communicate. Though the living could have the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right behind the Veil on the other side of the archway, their words were inaudible except for \"faint whispering and murmuring noises\" coming from the other side of the Veil. When the living person tried to communicate, the dead would try harder and their whispering and murmuring would become louder. If those who heard the whispering stared at the archway long enough, they would shortly become entranced and mesmerised by it, believing it had a kind of beauty about it (old though it was), unknowingly walking towards it, intrigued by the gently rippling Veil, and feeling a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk through it. It was impossible for others to pull whoever passed through out without passing through and dying themselves, and it was already too late for those passing through to be saved (despite only a few seconds passing), as they were already dead. When Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom, and Luna Lovegood travelled to the Ministry in 1996, they found themselves in the Death Chamber and strangely drawn to the Veil."

During the 1988\u20131989 school year, Mundungus Fletcher went to Ollivanders to ask about the wand of an opponent whom he had lost a duel to, but Garrick Ollivander couldn't tell much. Shortly afterwards, Jacob's sibling and a friend visited to find out about Fletcher, and Ollivander told them about the previous encounter with him. After Patricia Rakepick broke Jacob's sibling's wand, they went to Ollivanders to purchase a second wand. At some point near the end of the 1989\u20131990 school year, Jacob's sibling and Jae Kim came to Ollivanders to meet Mundungus Fletcher and Ollivander, who had some information on a dark witch who had been gathering information of Jacob's sibling and their wand (who turned out to be the Dark Witch in Knockturn Alley). During the 1990\u20131991 school year, Jacob's sibling and Ben Copper visited Ollivanders to investigate Ollivander's misfiring wand. After Jacob's sibling, Penny Haywood and Professor Snape successfully brewed a counter-serum for Xeep's Luscious Locks Solution, Jacob's sibling offered it to the victims of the solution, including Ollivander, in the shop.

  "summary": "Madam Professor Griselda Marchbanks was a British witch, who served as Governor of the Wizarding Examinations Authority that ran the O.W.L., N.E.W.T. Before resigning in 1995, Madam Marchbanks was one of the Wizengamot elders. By the late 1890s, Professor Marchbanks was already working for the Wizarding Examinations Authority in the capacity of examiner. In its 29 November 1926 issue, the Daily Prophet published an interview with Marchbanks, in which she expressed her disappointment with recent poor test outcomes in Charms. At some point in her life, Marchbanks became a member of the Wizengamot and was, until 1995, one of its oldest members. Before the year began, Harry Potter (whom the Ministry had actively been trying to discredit along with Dumbledore) was brought before the Wizengamot to stand trial for using the Patronus Charm in the presence of a Muggle; the assembly likely included Madam Marchbanks. When Dumbledore appeared to defend Harry, two witches (possibly Marchbanks and another) waved at him in welcome, and when the verdict was to be given, she likely voted to clear Harry of all charges given her support for Dumbledore. On 8 September 1995, with the passage of Educational Decree Number Twenty-Three, Dolores Umbridge was appointed High Inquisitor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry by then-Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge."

While Hit Wizards were trained to fight Dark Wizards, just like the Aurors, the latter appeared to differ in that unlike Hit Wizards, Aurors were more of an elite force whose abilities went far beyond simply arresting suspects such as investigation, concealment and disguise, stealth and tracking, poisons and antidotes, etc., whereas Hit Wizards appeared to be primarily a fighting and controlling force, and not trained to investigate crime."

The network was composed of the fireplaces of all the wizarding buildings, which were interconnected, and it allowed the user, or \"passenger\", to transport themselves to any other fireplace on the network. If a broom had been determined to be dangerous or tampered with to cause damage, this office would confiscate the broom. The Portkey Office regulated and authorised objects that were turned into portkeys, as well as the network in which they were used.

At the end of 1979, Lord Voldemort was at the peak of a reign of terror in the First Wizarding War. He would have a power that Voldemort was unable or unwilling to comprehend, who could one day kill him, and that Voldemort would pick the child who was equal to him. However, Neville was pure-blood while the second boy born the next day, Harry Potter, to Lily and James Potter, was half-blood like Voldemort. After receiving their whereabouts from his spy Peter Pettigrew, he went to their home in Godric's Hollow and killed both James and Lily but failed to kill Harry due to Lily sacrificing her own life to save her child which created a powerful protection within her son that deflected Voldemort's killing curse which backfired upon him and destroyed his body, forcing him to flee from Britain and leaving the Death Eaters in disarray and chaos. Bellatrix Lestrange, her husband Rodolphus, his brother Rabastan, and Barty Crouch Jr targeted both Frank and Alice Longbottom for information about where Voldemort was due to the couple's strong reputation as Aurors who had fought Voldemort and his supporters successfully. He was subjugated and imprisoned at an undisclosed location, before being heavily tortured by all four of the Death Eaters with the Cruciatus Curse."

During her school years she would regularly complain about mistreatment from other students and spread rumours, even once ending up in front of Dumbledore following an incident. Bertha was described as being a slightly plump girl with a sulky expression, though her expression could just be due to the fact she was complaining to Dumbledore. After graduating from Hogwarts, Bertha joined the Ministry of Magic and floated between Departments, including Department of International Magical Co-operation while Barty Crouch Snr was the Department Head. Bertha had the misfortune of making a visit to the estate of Crouch Snr with some papers for him to sign, where she discovered the Crouch family secret that they were keeping their convicted Death Eater son Barty Crouch Jnr trapped in their house under the Imperius Curse and an invisibility cloak when their house-elf Winky was talking to the criminal, of which Bertha heard enough to deduce who was under the cloak. When Bertha confronted Crouch Snr, he had to place a powerful Memory Charm on her to alter her memory and make her forget what she had found out. However, the Memory Charm was so powerful, in fact, that she suffered permanent brain damage, leading to the extreme forgetfulness she had since been known for. One night in a wayside inn, she ran into Peter Pettigrew, who the Ministry thought to be dead at the hands of Sirius Black."

Despite Fudge's claim that they would probably never meet again after the first introduction, circumstances, essentially all the Dark activities of the wizarding world, colluded to render this statement invalid, much to the Prime Minister's discomfort. In 1993, Fudge met with the Prime Minister to inform him that Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban. Since Black was convicted of murdering Peter Pettigrew and twelve Muggle bystanders on a London street, and was thus a severe threat to both communities, Fudge felt that it was important that the Muggle Prime Minister be informed. Subsequently, the Prime Minister put out a warning to the Muggle communities that Black was a known serial killer, but not specifically a wizard. In 1994, Fudge met with the Prime Minister to discuss the events of the Quidditch World Cup, where several Muggles had been tortured by Death Eaters, but declared that everything was fine and was being dealt with (i.e. He also informed the Prime Minister that they would be bringing three dragons and a sphinx into the country, and as they were classified as highly dangerous creatures, it was in the rules that the Muggle Prime Minister had to be informed. Then, later in 1996, the Prime Minister was under pressure after the collapse of the Brockdale Bridge, an alleged hurricane that had devastated parts of the South-West of England, and two highly publicised murders one of which had taken place around the corner from 10 Downing Street."

A telephone rested on the desk, and the Prime Minister kept a supply of whiskey in the office. Cornelius Fudge, Minister for Magic from 1990 to 1996, met two Prime Ministers in the office. The Prime Minister believed Fudge to be a hoax, a trick played on him by the opposing political party and promptly attempted to throw Fudge out of the office's window. When a new Prime Minister was elected, Fudge travelled to the office to introduce himself and reveal the existence of the Wizarding World. Despite Fudge's claim that they would probably never meet again after their first introduction since he would only need to meet the Prime Minister if incidents threatened the Muggle world, the Minister for Magic met the Prime Minister again in 1993 to inform him of Sirius Black's breakout from Azkaban. Convinced Black would be caught quickly, Fudge alerted the Prime Minister of the situation, and asked that the Muggles keep an eye out for Black, as well.

It was with this wand that Riddle murdered James and Lily Potter and countless others, including Muggle Frank Bryce, Amelia Bones, and Ministry of Magic ex-employee Bertha Jorkins. Riddle entered Ollivanders Wand Shop and purchased a wand thirteen and one half inches long, made of yew and with a core composed of a Phoenix feather which chose Riddle as its master. Over the course of his years at Hogwarts, Riddle's personality became darker and darker in secret, while to the outside world he appeared to be a model pupil. Although Riddle rose to stardom in the eyes of much of the Hogwarts staff, he was never fully trusted by Albus Dumbledore due to their first encounter at Riddle's orphanage, where he accidentally let his true personality show in Dumbledore's presence. In the summer of 1943, Riddle used his wand to enact a plot of revenge against his father, Tom Riddle Snr, who had abandoned Riddle's mother, Merope Gaunt, along with himself many years before and fled back to the village of Little Hangleton to live in his family's home, the Riddle House. Riddle then proceeded to the Riddle House and murdered his father and his Muggle grandparents, Thomas and Mary Riddle, with the Killing Curse using Morfin's wand."

Lucius was in possession of his wand/walking stick for the majority of his life, but when he was sent to Azkaban his son was seen in possession of the walking stick (though it is doubtful he used his father's wand much, rather continuing to use his own). After Azkaban, Lucius regained his wand, but it was taken by Lord Voldemort in order to solve Voldemort's problem with his and Harry's wand sharing the same core. Elm wands were said to be highly desirable to pure-blood supremacists, making it ideal for a Malfoy family heirloom. It is unknown if he carried a different wand earlier in his career as a wizard, though it seems likely he would have gone through at least one or two wands before acquiring this one. In 1993, after Lucius was magically blasted away by his former House-elf for trying to assault Harry Potter on the Grand Staircase, Lucius pulled out his wand to retaliate, but Dobby ordered him to leave, which he did.

The Crouch family seemed to have a penchant for the Dark Arts as Bartemius Crouch Junior joined the Death Eaters and his father Bartemius Crouch Senior was quite proficient in using the Imperious curse against the former. In addition, the Crouch family was a \"respectable\" pure-blood family as Charis Black married into this family while Barty Crouch Sr opposed Lord Voldemort. Bartemius Crouch Snr was a high-ranking and influential officer in the Ministry of Magic, and it was widely believed that he would have become Minister for Magic. As Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Crouch gave his son a life sentence in Azkaban but fulfilled his dying wife's last wish which was to switch her with her imprisoned son with the assistance of Polyjuice Potion. Due to such bad publicity, the Crouch family's status plummeted and Crouch Snr was demoted and shunned aside. After his death, sometime in\u00a01996, the Crouch family became extinct. Crouch is an English surname as well as a verb, meaning \"to bend down; to stoop low\" or \"to be servilely...to fawn; to cringe\", possibly referring to Barty Crouch Junior's role as a servant of Lord Voldemort. Furthermore, the River Crouch is a river that flows through the English county of Essex into the North Sea, the location of Azkaban, and Crouch End is an area of London known for having been the home of many writers in the fantasy genre."

  "summary": "A Shopping List was given to students attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry each year before their first term starting in September, listing what supplies they would need for that year. For first-years, it came along with their Hogwarts acceptance letters, for third-years, it comes along with Hogsmeade forms, and for sixth-years, it was received with their O.W.L. The Shopping List told students what equipment they would need for that year; it included books, uniforms and other wizarding paraphernalia. The different books and items were chosen by the teachers of each subject, so if the school had a new teacher, the books required for that subject may have changed. Not everyone in a particular year would need the same supplies, as students did not always take the same subjects. If a student did not have sufficient funds for an adequate reason, Hogwarts will supply a small bursary amount to buy their supplies, although some things would have to be bought second-hand."

Angus was the only Squib to take part in the Sorting ceremony at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and later became a player on the Muggle Scottish rugby team. This association was responsible for wizards' part in-joke interest in rugby, and worldwide wizarding support of the Scottish team. Later in Angus' life he published My Life as a Squib, a groundbreaking worldwide bestseller that brought the plight of Squibs to the wizarding world's attention. After his death, he was honoured by both wizards and Muggles (an almost unique achievement in history). To this day, the Wizarding Supporters of Scottish Rugby Union meet on the eve of every Scottish international match to toast Buchanan's memory. Angus Buchanan was born on 15 January, 1847, to the Pure-blood Buchanan family, in a village in the Scottish Borders. However, he enjoyed a good relationship with his brothers and sisters, who were all very fond of him \u2014 he would, years later, attribute his aptitude for cricket to the years of helping his siblings catch Golden Snitches in their back garden. The household was, naturally, loud and chaotic, which perhaps accounts for neither of the Buchanan parents realising that Angus was actually born a Squib."

 "blood traitor": {

  "summary": "\"Blood traitor\" is a derogatory term commonly used by elite pure-blood wizarding families to describe witches or wizards who sympathise with the non-magical community or willingly associate with other such sympathisers or with Muggle-borns. Other similar terms include; \"Muggle-lover\", \"Mudblood-lover\", \"Dunglicker\", \"Scumsucker\", as well as \"Mudwallower\". All these refer disparagingly to those who are comfortable in the company of Muggles or Muggle-borns, whom prejudiced wizards and witches believe are dirty and inferior. Among those usually considered to be \"blood traitors\" are;\nPure-bloods who marry Muggle-borns or Muggles, such as Andromeda Tonks. Pure-bloods or half-bloods who openly reject the doctrine of blood purity or openly support equal rights for Muggle-borns and Muggles. The Weasley family is notorious for this as well, particularity Arthur Weasley, who always had an intense fondness for anything to do with Muggles. Sirius Black is also known for this, befriending many Muggle-born witches and wizards. Most pure-blood wizards and witches consider themselves to be the elite of the wizarding world, akin to aristocracy. They look down upon half-bloods, Muggle-borns, and half-breeds, as well as consider the Muggle world to be inferior to their own."

In Harry's third year, Sybill Trelawney served her Divination class tea, and had them read the remaining tea leaves after they drank. Remus Lupin was fond of making it from a kettle, and offered Harry Potter a cup whilst discussing the first Defence Against the Dark Arts class of that year, in which Lupin prevented Harry from facing the Boggart in the Wardrobe. He noted that he had only teabags at the moment, but quipped that Harry had probably \"had enough of tea leaves\", referencing Professor Trelawney's tea-leaf reading, which he had heard about. In 1994, after showing fourth year students in Defence Against the Dark Arts the Unforgivable Curses, Bartemius Crouch Junior (disguised as Alastor Moody) pretended to comfort a distressed Neville Longbottom by having him come into his office for a cup of tea."

Needless to say, Riddle's award had nothing to do with Hogwarts' Giant Squid, and Viktor was unharmed, as the squid was demonstrably not a threat to anyone. However since squid in the wild can change their colour using cells called chromatophores that lay just below the surface of the skin, it is entirely possible the Giant Squid was also able to change colours and even patterns at will."

This body's physical abilities were extremely limited and while in this form, Voldemort needed Wormtail to transport him from place to place and tend to him constantly. This body was used until Voldemort, with the aid of Peter Pettigrew and Bartemius Crouch Junior, was able to create the ancient Regeneration potion to finally restore him to his true body and abilities. Prior to that, the body that the potion provided Voldemort was so gruesome, it revolted both Frank Bryce and Harry Potter greatly, and caused Pettigrew to flinch when seeing it, and shudder when holding it. Because Voldemort's body was severely limited, he could not milk Nagini for her venom, let alone brew the potion, hence he could not allow Pettigrew leave his side."

James had died trying to protect the family; Sirius very obviously had died fighting along with Harry, and then his mum who most explicitly had died for him. It was all the previous generation, and they were all strongly parental figures for Harry.\" Rowling wrote this very carefully, so it could be read two ways."

Cuar\u00f3n made a great many changes to the Harry Potter film series, all of which were met with either great acclaim or stiff opposition by Harry Potter fans. Many caused serious continuity errors in relation to the previous two films, which were directed by Chris Columbus. These include Cuar\u00f3n's changing the appearance and layout of Hogwarts Castle, by adding the Clock Tower, the Central tower and changing the location of Hagrid's Hut. When he was first signed on, he asked Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint to write a short essay on their characters. After graduating, Cuar\u00f3n began working in television in Mexico, first as a technician and then as a director. Cuar\u00f3n's television work led to assignments as an assistant director for several Latin American film productions (including Gaby: A True Story and Romero), and in 1991, he landed his first big-screen directorial assignment. Solo con tu pareja was a dark comedy about a womanising businessman who learns he's contracted AIDS; the film was a massive hit in Mexico, and was enthusiastically received around the world."

  "summary": "The Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery was a bylaw of the British Ministry of Magic, written in 1875, which banned the use of underage magic outside of school. Overall, it appeared that the Ministry of Magic generally limited enforcement of the decree to situations where underage wizards performed magic in front of Muggles. However, Clause 7 also stated that magic could be used in front of Muggles in exceptional circumstances, including situations when the life of the witch or wizard using the spell, or the lives of other witches, wizards and Muggles were threatened. It seemed that a high-authority person might give permission for an underage student to perform magic under circumstances; as Hogwarts Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore gave Harry Potter such an instruction if an attack was to eventuate, when he was 16 years old. Also, if an underage student unintentionally performed magic out of emotional stress, the Ministry might consider this to be accidental magic, and not punish said student, as Dumbledore noted that even the best of adult wizards couldn't always control their emotions, and Fudge did somewhat take this into account when he spoke to Harry about it."

The freed boa briefly thanked Harry and told him that it was going to Brazil, the native range of its species. From there, the snake calmly slithered out of the reptile house. Lonely and bored, the snake found it highly annoying to have zoo visitors tap on the tank's glass front every day. He also had a rather playful side, as he made a point of snapping at the heels of panicking Muggles as he left his former prison but without intent to hurt them. Interestingly, the snake seemed to be capable of reading; when Harry asked if it missed its family in Brazil, it pointed to a sign which read \"RAISED IN CAPTIVITY\"."

In 1994, Death Eater Peter Pettigrew milked the venom from Nagini's fangs and used it, along with unicorn blood, to concoct a dark potion, which allowed Lord Voldemort's shattered soul to regain a rudimentary, but physical form. This form was very weak, and it greatly inhibited Voldemort's capabilities, but granted him the ability to hold a his wand and enough energy to perform sufficient magic, until he could regain his true form. Until then, Voldemort required the potion every few hours to keep his crippled body alive, and Pettigrew had to continuously milk Nagini for the venom to keep feeding his master. It was for this reason that Voldemort refused to let Wormtail escape under the lie to find another wizard for the true rebirth ceremony, as Voldemort himself could not milk Nagini for the venom and concoct the potion. In 1995, when Nagini was sent by Voldemort to infiltrate the Department of Mysteries, she met up with Arthur Weasley, who was sent by Albus Dumbledore to guard the prophecy, on behalf of the Order of the Phoenix. Arthur was sent to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, and was to take a Blood-Replenishing Potion every hour to counter the blood loss that would otherwise cost him his life, but was otherwise fine."

Both Rubeus Hagrid and Mundungus Fletcher were fond of alcoholic beverages, though the former seemed generally more able to handle them responsibly than the latter, as Fletcher was often known to smell of stale drink, though this also likely had some influence from Hagrid's knowledge that he is far more dangerous when intoxicated than the average person due to his sheer size and generally impulsive behaviour. It was also likely rather difficult for Hagrid to become intoxicated due to his outrageous size, as the amount of alcohol it takes to become drunk is relative to a person's size. This, however, did not stop Draco Malfoy from once trying to slander Hagrid by stating that he was \"...a sort of savage - lives in a hut in the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed.\" After realising that he had given up the secret of how to calm Fluffy to Quirinus Quirrell due to being under the influence of drink, Hagrid claimed that he would never drink again.

The wind could also entrap people, preventing them from leaving due to the violent wind speed. Ventus Duo and Ventus Tria were stronger versions of this spell, creating far more violent gusts of wind. In 1927, London, Newt Scamander used this spell to shake off a pursuer by the name of Stebbins, an Auror whom the Ministry of Magic had sent to tail him. The spell was strong enough to first stop him in his tracks, before blowing him backwards in the opposite direction, much to the bemusement of passing Muggles, who were not affected by it whatsoever and were unable to explain such a strange phenomenon. During the 2008\u20132009 school year, Cassandra Vole used this spell in the Duelling Club."

In 1997, as Hermione Granger considered what books to bring along on the mission to find Voldemort's Horcruxes, she tossed her copy of Defensive Magical Theory into the bin without a second glance. After receiving a letter from Lily Evans about the birth of Harry, Petunia Dursley tossed it in the bin without a second glance. In \"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\", one of the classic stories from The Tales of Beedle the Bard, the wizard who inherited his father's titular pot initially decided to use it as a bin, but the pot did not allow him rest until he used it for its original purpose of helping his Muggle neighbours, as did his father."

They could unscrew chandeliers, write rude words on chalkboards, throw water balloons at people, throw walking sticks at people, stuff keyholes with chewing gum and other such acts, simply for their amusement. More destructive poltergeists who had inhabited a location for a longer period of time were harder to expel, but it was not impossible to do. In more serious cases, some people (notably Albus Dumbledore and the Bloody Baron) could get the poltergeist to settle down for a while, though it would inevitably start acting up again. Dolores Umbridge claimed that the Minister for Magic could sign an order banning a poltergeist, and once threatened Peeves with this action. However, her statement might reflect her belief in the superiority of wizards in general and the Ministry of Magic in particular, rather than specific knowledge of the nature of poltergeists, and that her efforts would be wasted. Whilst similar, poltergeists differed from ghosts in a number of ways. Firstly, ghosts were incorporeal, whereas the poltergeist, despite not normally having a physical form, was solid enough to move objects with physical force."

  "summary": "A Magizoologist was a wizard or witch who studied magical creatures professionally (a field known as magizoology); though they may also have been referred to as wizarding naturalists. In certain cases, a magizoologist's obligations may have not been limited to merely observing and taking care of magical creatures, as they may even have been immersed in sanctioned breeding, and even actively tracking and rescuing them from less-principled parties. A wizard or witch may not have needed to have graduated from a Wizarding school to become a Magizoologist, as Newt Scamander was expelled from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and still managed to become a highly renowned Magizoologist in his adult life. Early in life, Scamander developed an interest in magical\u00a0creatures that was influenced by his\u00a0mother's breeding of\u00a0hippogriffs. A Care of Magical Creatures was a class taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for students who wish to learn about magical beasts. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was a required textbook and the professor of the subject could be counted as an magizoologist, since they were educating others about creatures."

The Potter family was excluded from the list because it was also a common Muggle surname, and that Henry Potter also took an outspoken pro-Muggle view during his time in the Wizengamot. This was despite Dorea Black marrying Charlus Potter, and not being disowned, which would almost certainly indicate that the family had no known Muggle ancestors or relatives. One possible theory indicates that the author of the Directory considered the Potters and other \"pure-blood\" families (such as the Princes, the Crabbes, or the Goyles) to have some amount of Muggle ancestry. Some families (most famously the Weasley family) spoke out against the list in spite of their inclusion, declaring that they certainly had muggle ancestry and were not ashamed of it. Although the Malfoys were noted as respectable members as one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight (a title they are proud of), they did not take the pure-blood supremacy to the point of inbreeding: they were willing to marry half-bloods, many of whom are shown in their family tree. As they had no Muggles or Muggle-borns in their family tree, they were still a pure-blood family, just not as fanatic as the Blacks, Gaunts, and Lestranges, whose members do not marry half-bloods, Muggles, or Muggle-borns. Tom Riddle Jnr killed Morfin Gaunt, the last surviving male member of the family, who did not have children; Riddle had an illegitimate daughter, Delphini, who is currently in Azkaban."

The party was interrupted by the arrival of Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour, who wanted Harry to support the Ministry of Magic during the Second Wizarding War. Harry Potter lived with his maternal relatives, the Dursley family, after his father and mother were murdered by Lord Voldemort on 31 October, 1981. Because his aunt Petunia Dursley is the older sister of Harry's mother, whose loving sacrifice protected him from Voldemort's Killing Curse, Harry was protected by ancient magic while he lived with his aunt. This protection would expire when Harry became an adult in the wizarding world, on his seventeenth birthday of 31 July, 1997. Thus, the Death Eaters manipulated the Ministry of Magic to cut off Harry's means of transportation away from 4 Privet Drive, and the Order made a plan to remove Harry on 27 July. The Order used Polyjuice Potion to disguise six members as Harry, so that seven teams of two would fly away from Little Whinging to divert anyone if they were attacked. Harry was brought to safety at the\u00a0Burrow, but Alastor Moody and Harry's owl Hedwig were killed in the process.

There is a great deal of prejudice against half-breeds in the wizarding world, which also tends to discriminate against non-human beings in general. Half-breeds share the attributes of both their parents, still being able to use magic, as the magic gene is dominant, while having traits of their non-human parent as well. It is also unknown for how many generations non-human traits will persist, although it seems that wizards and witches with even one non-human great-grandparent will retain some of those characteristics. It is unknown if Muggles can interbreed with non-humans and if they can, this would probably result in non-magical half-breeds. Many wizards and witches are prejudiced against non-human beings, from house-elves to goblins to centaurs, as well as extend this prejudice to those with mixed heritage. When Rubeus Hagrid's status as a half-giant was exposed by Rita Skeeter in 1994, many parents of his students at Hogwarts were alarmed, assuming that Hagrid must have been savage and dim-witted because of his ancestry. It is also possible that there is less prejudice toward different types of half-breeds, as part-Veela Fleur Delacour never seemed to suffer any discrimination based on her heritage."

On the other hand, Lily was offered the chance to step aside because Voldemort had promised Severus Snape that he wouldn't kill her unless she got in his way. Although Voldemort was determined to kill Harry, his sacrificial protection worked to save his friends, presumably because he willingly gave himself up despite having enough time to try to run away, whereas James was only given a minute's notice of Voldemort's arrival. After the sacrifice, the protection would live on in the beneficiary's veins. In cases involving a single person, the protection prevented whoever had murdered the victim from physically touching the beneficiary without experiencing excruciating pain, and would cause a Killing Curse cast at the beneficiary by the murderer to rebound.

As the Weasley family was poor, Ron Weasley had to make do with second-hand robes. The old robes were given to Ron, who showed much reluctance to wear them, even going as far to make Molly Weasley suggest him to go naked and have Harry Potter get a photograph. After getting dressed for the ball, in a desperate attempt to make his robes look more \"manly\", he used a severing charm on the ruff and cuffs which eliminated the lace but he did not do a very neat job and the edges ended up frayed looking. Ron's date to the ball was Padma Patil, who was unhappy to be seen with him because his robes were so hideously embarrassing. Ron and Padma did not dance at all once at the ball, though this was also because Ron spent most of it jealously watching Hermione Granger dance with Viktor Krum.

Where the tapestry was located in these earlier times is unknown, but it was passed down to subsequent generations of Blacks, and found its place at 12 Grimmauld Place, home of the last living members of the family by the late twentieth century. The tapestry was in the Black family for seven centuries, being passed down to descendants through the ages, finding its way into their homes, and by most members of the family it was treated as an object of reverance, representing their pure-blood heritage, which the House of Black held in great esteem. Despite this general respect of the object, some Blacks, the earliest known being Eduardus Limette, and the most recent being Sirius Black III were disowned for various reasons; supporting Muggle rights, being Squibs, fraternising with other disowned people, etc., and treated the item with resentment and direspect. During the mid-twentieth century, Walburga Black, mother of some of the last members of the family, was in charge of blasting off the tapestry images of the disowned members of the family. Walburga was presumably responsible for most of the removals, but some family members, such as Iola Black, were disowned before her birth, hinting that others took this job at one point.

He served in France as part of his country's Expeditionary Forces, and remained stationed there well after the conclusion of the war (presumably as part of a peace-keeping effort), returning to the United States in 1924. Due to his extended service, he was only able to find a menial job at a cannery in his post-war life, which lead to him being unable to secure the loan he needed to fulfil his dream of opening a bakery. During the war, British Minister for Magic Archer Evermonde was responsible for passing emergency legislation forbidding wizards and witches from getting involved, in an attempt to prevent mass breaches of the International Statue of Secrecy. Rolanda Hooch's broomstick was singed by an \"overzealous\" anti-aircraft device sometime during the First World War. Theseus Scamander was among the wizards who participated in the First World War, later earning a reputation as a \"war hero.\" His younger brother, the magizoologist Newt Scamander, was part of a secret British Ministry of Magic operation to wrangle Ukrainian Ironbellies on the Eastern Front. The wizarding war effort in Europe included an \"Owl Airforce\" although whether it was used for deploying attacks, sending messages, surveillance, or some combination of the three is unknown."

Immediately after the disaster, a police rescue team started pulling survivors from the river, even while the bridge continued to crumble around them. Westminster's Anti-Terrorism Unit and the Metropolitan Police could retrieve \"nothing of value\" to help figure out the responsible or how whatever devices used had been planted on the bridge without anyone seeing them before, during, and after the attack. CCTV footage retrieved by Anna Hill-Hall of the Metropolitan Police did not provide any clues, not did amateur footage, such as Anji Oliver's recording of the incident in her mobile phone camera \u2014 the blasts could be seen, but no source could be identified, even though they seemed to have been fired onto the bridge. Penelope Taylor suffered a broken leg and pelvis in the collapse, although she recognised that she could have been one of the casualties if she did not stop to try and see the \"plumes of smoke\" she had glimpsed in the sky. While some Muggles, like Taylor, thought that the attack could not have been the work of any human foe (\"I know that these were devils, punishing us for our decadent Western lifestyle\"), others, like Lucy Evans, were more earth-bound and blamed foreigners."

Then, the first will ask a certain number of vows of the other, whereupon each time the second accepts a term, a thin stream of fire will be emitted from the witness's wand, weaving around the hands of the pair taking the vows. Sometime prior to 1901, Yusuf Kama made an Unbreakable Vow with his father where he promised to track down and kill the son of Corvus Lestrange in retaliation for taking Yusuf's mother away from them. This vow, however, turned out to be null and void, as the child he thought was his intended victim turned out to be someone else entirely, and the person whom he had sworn to kill was already long dead. In either 1985 or 1986, Fred and George Weasley attempted to convince their then five-year-old brother Ron to make an Unbreakable Vow with them. It was described as the only time he was as angry as his wife, and it is said that he did something to Fred's left buttock leaving it never the same again; luckily however, their brother Ron was left unhurt, although he remembered the incident at least eleven years later. At some point between 1984 and 1990, Jacob's sibling offered to make an Unbreakable Vow with Chiara Lobosca to ensure they would never betray her."

While many of the acolytes were fervent believers in Grindelwald\u2019s mantra of magical supremacy at any cost, most were simply idealistic young witches and wizards who were taken in by the dark wizard's charisma and manipulation. Between about 1900, when Grindelwald fled Britain, and 1945, the year of his downfall, Dark Wizard Gellert Grindelwald formed an army of witches and wizards. Grindelwald intended to unite the Deathly Hallows, which he believed would make him and his followers invincible. There, he gave a rousing speech, in which he shared his idealist perspective of non-magic people and told of the Second World War, implying it would come to pass if the army lost to the wizarding governments. Grindelwald, openly recognising the battalion of Aurors that had infiltrated the rally, told his followers to remain calm as he revealed their presence and invited them into the circle. They killed a young witch, making Grindelwald's followers furious. After making a martyr of the girl, Grindelwald commanded his followers to disapparate from the scene while he faced off against the Aurors."

By 1926, the castle also served as the headquarters for Grindelwald and his Alliance during the Global wizarding war. After a number of years of terrorising Europe, Grindelwald was confronted and defeated in a duel between him and his former best friend and lover Albus Dumbledore in 1945. It is unknown if there were any other prisoners ever held at Nurmengard, but around the time of Grindelwald's death, it is likely that he was the only prisoner present as the past inmates were likely incarcerated there at Grindelwald's behest. Grindelwald was certainly fed and kept alive for fifty-three years, so there was at least a supply of food and someone (or something) bringing it to him, although he was emaciated, frail and missing teeth. In his quest for the Elder Wand, Lord Voldemort travelled to Nurmengard in 1998, using his skills of Flight and possibly Human Transfiguration to break into Grindelwald's cell. After confronting him for information on the Wand's location, Voldemort killed Grindelwald and then flew away."

As Equiano span out of control, Sato soared through the middle of the action to seize the Snitch from the midst of distracted Nigerian players intent on saving their teammate in the 63rd minute. Boris Vulchanov, a Bulgarian Beater, deliberately intercepted a Bludger with his body to protect Viktor Krum, the Bulgerian Seeker. Krum, instead of taking advantage of Sato's temporary incapacitation, Krum pulled up and let the Snitch go by. The Snitch appeared for the second time and Sato raced against Krum, but lost. Later, Sato was led to believe that Krum was escaping Hongo's line of sight when he had really spotted the Snitch and dived for it, leading Bulgaria to victory."

  "summary": "Probation was a disciplinary status that teachers at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry could be placed under, in which the staff in question would be monitored more closely to evaluate their future performances, with possible dismissal if their teaching standards did not improve. During his time as Headmaster, Armando Dippet placed Care of Magical Creatures Professor Silvanus Kettleburn on sixty-two periods of probation, though he never found cause to dismiss him. As part of her role as Hogwarts High Inquisitor, Dolores Umbridge was granted the power to inspect teachers, with the supposed purpose of eventually removing those not found to be up to the educational standards set by the Ministry of Magic. She first placed Sybill Trelawney on probation and began inspecting all future lessons of hers, in which Umbridge heavily harassed Trelawney with difficult questions and peer pressure, causing the latter to falter more and more, eventually dismissing her from her teaching post. Rubeus Hagrid was also placed under probation, and like Trelawney, he was faltering from Umbridge's presence, though he escaped from Hogwarts and went into hiding, rather than allowing himself to be formally dismissed. Severus Snape, too, was briefly placed on probation after he stated to Umbridge that it would take a month for him to procure Veritaserum in order for her pursue her goal of interrogating Harry Potter; Snape took this with little concern, and simply left the room apathetically. This period of probation lasted less than a day, however, as Umbridge was soon removed from her post as Hogwarts High Inquisitor and Headmistress once Dumbledore returned to the school. Contradicting to the purpose of a probation, which is to give incentive to the teacher to improve themselves, Umbridge abused her position to further weaken Trelawney and Hagrid's performances under her supervision, as Harry correctly suspected that she was trying to achieve a sacking soon."

  "summary": "In June 1995, Harry Potter came back from the final task of the Triwizard Tournament carrying the body of fellow champion Cedric Diggory, claiming to have witnessed Cedric's murder at the hands of Lord Voldemort, the notorious Dark Wizard who he had vanquished as a baby fourteen years prior and who was thought to be dead by the wizarding world at large. Incumbent Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, refused to believe either Harry or Albus Dumbledore (who had long believed that Voldemort was certain to return at some point) and instead devoted his time and effort to slandering the two viciously, as he believed it was some insidious plot to usurp him. A Dementor attack on Harry and his cousin in the Muggle suburb of Little Whinging nearly got Harry expelled from Hogwarts when he violated the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery by casting a Patronus Charm in self-defence, but he was found not guilty by the court thanks to Dumbledore. Fudge also used his influence to force Hogwarts to accept a Ministry-appointed teacher, his Senior Undersecretary Dolores Umbridge, in order to gain control of the school and limit Dumbledore's power there. Hagrid's half-giant status also meant that Umbridge was highly prejudiced against him, viewing him as a \"filthy half-breed\", and so she became quite determined to get rid of him. Umbridge's biased and insulting inspections of his classes made Hagrid rather nervous, and he was soon placed on probation. Though Dumbledore was able to prevent him from being sacked outright, he was forced to flee the school when an illegal student organisation, Dumbledore's Army, was discovered and treated as proof of his supposed treason and Umbridge was named Headmistress in his place. Hagrid's case was not helped by the open rebellion of the school against Umbridge which had one student, Lee Jordan, causing havoc for her by placing Nifflers in her office to wreck the place, one of which also tried to bite a chunk out of her as well. On the night of Wednesday 17th June, 1996, Umbridge and a delegation of five Aurors, including John Dawlish, set out of the castle to arrest Hagrid."

The real reason, however, was just an excuse to give Dolores Umbridge more power over the other teachers, and to eliminate any potential threat against the Ministry of Magic. Others were revolted by the creation of said post: Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden, both active members of the Wizengamot, left their posts at the Ministry in protest and were subsequently discredited by the Daily Prophet (which connected them to subversive Goblin groups). Because of the post's intrusive purpose, many teachers find it offensive as well, as Professors Minerva McGonagall and Severus Snape tried their best to ignore Umbridge's interrupting methods, answering her in a haughty and cold manner. Sybill Trelawney, who had a harder time in keeping her emotion, was very offended by Umbridge's inspection, and believed it was an insult from the establishment. The decree was abolished and excluded from law after Dolores Umbridge's suspension from her post of High Inquisitor and Albus Dumbledore's formal reinstatement to the post of Headmaster, following the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, in the summer of 1996."

Supposedly certain people, such as parents of students, were supportive of this post, as they feared that Dumbledore's eccentric decisions may have had a negative impact on the students and were glad that the Ministry was keeping an eye on the situation; however, Lucius Malfoy, who gave an interview of his support of the post's creation under the false pretence of caring for the school's future, was in truth desiring for this action to discredit Dumbledore. Other people, such as Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden, were outraged by this post's formation, as they supported Dumbledore and knew full well that the High Inquisitor was nothing more than an excuse for Fudge to usurp control over Hogwarts from the headmaster. As High Inquisitor, Umbridge lurked in the corners of many classes taking notes on her clipboard and asking teachers and students questions. She was disliked by most of the teachers at Hogwarts, especially Minerva McGonagall, who was especially curt and rude to her at times. Despite McGonagall and Snape's apathetic and cold treatment of her, Umbridge could not deny that they were good teachers and knew their subjects, and thus they were not sacked. After a series of poor performances in Umbridge's inspections, were she was unable to answer a series of questions, she was put on probation and then fired from the post of Divination teacher."

However, within regions of the wizarding world that historically did not use wands, wandless magic was considered the norm, and using one was optional. Wands were used by witches and wizards to channel their magic, making their spells more accurate and potent. Within cultures where wands were ubiquitous, only the most powerful and disciplined wizards and witches could perform wandless magic reliably. Wandless magic was not officially taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry; however, books on the subject were found in the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts Library. Wandless magic could also be performed nonverbally, but this increased the level of difficulty to the point that only practitioners of exceptional skill could perform more than the most basic magic. Gellert Grindelwald, an infamous Dark Wizard active in the Global wizarding war, was also extremely skilled with wandless magic, having performed it numerous times without difficulty during the conflict. Wandless spells were often used in cases of underage magic, in which children under the age of eleven, who had no wands, sometimes used magic."

Here amongst the smoke and grime, patrons will likely see dodgy dealings, goblin jazz singers and house-elves serving gigglewater. The band features a lot of different instruments that needed to be played but only four goblins to play them all so, out of practical necessity, the overworked goblin that acted as the brass section became a multi-instrumentalist. Newt Scamander visited The Blind Pig while looking for information about the trouble befalling New York in 1926 and spoke with the owner Gnarlak in person."

It is possible that he was taught by Salazar Slytherin himself, given the time period Merlin lived in. It is said that Merlin's wand was of English oak (though his grave has never been found, so this cannot be proven). Either while or after he attended the school, Merlin studied the five secret rooms at the school that would one day come to be known as the fabled Cursed Vaults and, not only the purpose for their existence, but also the ancient magic surrounding them. Later on in his life, as an old man, a portrait was painted by him, which he educated to speak and act like himself, and taught about the vaults so that once hung at Hogwarts, it could advise future residents about them, although its warnings were cryptic and, thus, of little use in regard to finding the vaults and breaking the curses. At some point in his lifetime, Merlin became a part of the Court of King Arthur, assisting him during his reign. It is also widely believed by the wizarding community that he was friends with Sir Cadogan, which helped him secure a position on the Knights of the Round Table. He was the enemy of Arthur's half-sister, Morgan le Fay (otherwise known as Morgana), a dark witch.

On 1 March 1997, Ron Weasley was almost killed inadvertently by Horace Slughorn after offering him mead that had been poisoned. That night Cormac McLaggen waited up in the common room for Harry Potter to ensure that he would play Keeper for next week's match against Hufflepuff. All during the week McLaggen offered unwanted advice on strategy, which led Harry to avoid him as much as possible. On the morning of Saturday 8 March, the day of the match, Harry visited Ron in the Hospital Wing as he was not able to participate, or even attend, the match. On his way to the pitch he ran across Draco Malfoy with Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe disguised under Polyjuice Potion as two girls, who were heading somewhere other than the pitch. Arriving at the changing rooms, Ginny Weasley demanded where he had been as the whole team was changed and Beaters Ritchie Coote and Jimmy Peakes, were hitting their clubs against their legs nervously. Zacharias Smith, who provided commentary for the previous match, took the Quaffle initially but Ginny flew into him and took the ball. Cadwallader, whose name Luna thought was Bibble or Buggins, then took the Quaffle back for Hufflepuff and scored, putting Hufflepuff in the lead 10-0. After Harry accosted McLaggen for criticising Ginny, she and fellow Chaser Demelza Robins each scored making it 20-10 for Gryffindor."

When Lyall proposed marriage, Hope accepted, and eagerly dedicated herself to planning their nuptials. The wedding took place in early 1959, the cake featuring a Boggart-shaped topper, a whimsical touch on Hope's part. A year later, on 10 March, 1960, Hope and Lyall's first and only child, Remus John Lupin, was born. In early 1965, Fenrir Greyback attacked the Lupins' house, having been insulted by Lyall at the Ministry of Magic sometime prior. Her son was bitten and turned into a werewolf, and despite her husband's many attempts to revert the transformation, there was no cure. Thus, they moved from village to village, moving when their neighbours began to take notice of their son's strange behaviour. Along with her husband, Hope worried that her son would not be able to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, due to his lycanthropy, but Albus Dumbledore made a special provision for him. During his years at Hogwarts, her son would say Hope was ill and he had to go and visit her, as an excuse for his monthly disappearances which were actually caused by lycanthropy. In spite of Remus's elaborate lies, his friends, James Potter, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew guessed the truth in their second year. However, as Hope had already died by the defeat of Lord Voldemort in 1981, there may have been some truth to Remus's words of her being \"ill\"."

Harry and Voldemort's wands connected in Priori Incantatem, and while Harry managed to escape physically unscathed (with the exception of his arm slit open) with the body of Cedric Diggory, the emotional toll of the traumatic experience of watching a classmate murdered, his arm bleeding, Wormtail slicing off his own hand, and Voldemort be reborn, was great. When their attempts to steal the Philosopher's Stone were thwarted by Harry Potter, he returned to Albania believing that he would never return to power. Peter Pettigrew, also known as Wormtail, had betrayed the Potters to Voldemort fourteen years previous, and framed Sirius Black for the crime. Lord Voldemort planned to use Harry Potter's blood as part of a dark potion that would return him to his body, assuming correctly that the use of Potter's blood would override the protection afforded to Harry by his mother's sacrifice, and allow Voldemort to touch Harry without experiencing excruciating pain."

The winner's wand forced\u00a0the loser's wand to produce \"echoes\" of the most recent spells performed in reverse order. As dictated by the subtle laws of wands, when a duel occurrs between wizards with wand cores harvested from the same creature, simultaneous spell-casting by both parties triggers a rare, powerful effect called Priori Incantatem. The two wand holders are then forced to compete in a battle of wills, by forcing golden beads of light to move along through the beam back towards their opponent. When one wand managed to overcome the other, it forced the losing wand to regurgitate \"echoes\" of the most recent spells it had cast, in reverse order. If one of these spells was the Killing Curse, then a ghostly \"echo\" of the murdered person could emerge from the killer's wand. However, these \"echoes\" were not ghosts,\u00a0nor were they considered to be returning the deceased person from the dead; indeed, they could only linger on the mortal plane for a few moments before they faded back into the Beyond. Amos Diggory cast the Reverse Spell on Harry Potter's wand in the aftermath of the Death Eater attack at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup in order to determine whether he conjured the Dark Mark over the campsite."

During the Calamity which affected the Wizarding world in the 2010s, the Gemino Curse affected various objects that were trapped as Foundables by constantly duplicating them, one such example being various Quidditch World Cup trophies. There was much debate over whether a copy created with the Doubling Charm held the same value as the original, as the two items were impossible to tell apart at first, being identical to one another. It is also unknown as to whether or not the Doubling Charm could duplicate living or sentient beings, or if it was able to replicate an object's magical properties. Furthermore, as dictated by the Fundamental Laws of Magic, the Doubling Charm did not affect metaphysical or fundamental entities, such as the soul, as when Hermione Granger used it to create a decoy of Slytherin's Locket, the soul fragment within was not doubled, hence Lord Voldemort's death at the Battle of Hogwarts.

 "eagle door knocker": {

  "summary": "The eagle door knocker of Ravenclaw Tower was a bronze, eagle-shaped knocker on the door to the Ravenclaw Common Room, which acted as the Tower's guardian in much the same way as the Fat Lady did for Gryffindor Tower. Unlike the Fat Lady, however, the knocker did not ask for a password, but instead for a thought-provoking question that had to be answered in order to enter. Such questions included:\nThe questions typically have no straight forward answer, but require a level of reasoning or logic behind them that reflects the wisdom of the hopeful entrant to the tower. The knocker would not let anyone in who did not know the answer to its question, though if someone else answered the question, one may have entered with the help of another who answers correctly. When Luna Lovegood and Harry Potter attempted to enter Ravenclaw Tower just before the Battle of Hogwarts with the purpose of seeing a statue depicting Ravenclaw's lost diadem, the knocker waylaid them with a question to which Luna answered. Moments later, the knocker halted Amycus Carrow, who could not answer its question, and attempted to blast and bludgeon his way past the door instead. The knocker's question was answered correctly by Minerva McGonagall, whom Carrow demanded open the door. The knocker had a soft, musical voice, and seemingly payed little heed to any sort of dialogue other than that of answering its question, again a difference to the Fat Lady."

In order to enter the room, a person must answer a riddle asked by the eagle knocker; if they answered incorrectly, they must wait for someone else who got it right. It was a wide, circular room with graceful arched windows that punctuated the walls which were hung with blue and bronze silks and a midnight blue carpet covered in stars, which was reflected onto the domed ceiling. The Ravenclaws also had their own library within the common room, which was nowhere as big as the main library, but had almost as many books. During the day, Ravenclaw students had a spectacular view of the school grounds, including the Great Lake, Forbidden Forest, Quidditch pitch, Herbology greenhouses and the surrounding mountains. In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, the Ravenclaw Common Room was two-stories and had bookshelves on the bottom floor."

A password was required to enter it; whereupon a passage was revealed leading to the common room. The common room was a dungeon-like room with greenish lamps and chairs. The common room had lots of low backed black and dark green button-tufted, leather sofas; skulls; and dark wood cupboards. The password to the common room changed every fortnight, and it was posted on the noticeboard. Slytherin students were warned never to bring students from other houses into the common room, or to reveal the password. Supposedly, no outsider had entered the common room for more than seven centuries until Harry and Ron entered Slytherin common room in 1992."

The wizarding currency of Great Britain consisted of three different coins; in decreasing order of value, they were: Galleon, Sickle, and Knut. There were 17 Sickles in a Galleon, and 29 Knuts in a Sickle, meaning there were 493 Knuts in a Galleon. Aside from the Philosopher's Stone, which could convert any metal into pure gold, there was no known method of magically producing precious metals. Attempting to duplicate money with the Doubling Charm was ineffective, as the duplicates would break down over time, and were considered worthless. In ancient times, before modern forms of currency were invented, primitive wizards were known to trade in leaves of Niffler's Fancy \u2014 a plant whose leaves gleam like copper. The three denominations of wizarding currency were sometimes represented with the following set of symbols:\nGalleons were Spanish treasure ships often raided by pirates. \"Sickle\" is the ancient Greek term for the shekel, the currency of Judea, as rendered by William Tyndale in his translation of the Greek New Testament, (later the King James Bible)."

The tables in the Great Hall were strewn with Wizard Crackers, wonderful crackers that sounded like gunshots when pulled and were filled with real sized hats, wizard chess sets, live mice and jokes. For the Christmas holiday in 1984, most students (including Ben Copper) and Severus Snape left the school. Those who stayed were Jacob's sibling, Rowan Khanna, Penny Haywood, Bill and Charlie Weasley, Nymphadora Tonks and Merula Snyde. There was a blizzard around Hogwarts during the Christmas holiday in 1985, due to Jacob's sibling's failed attempt of magnifying the Snowflake-making spell. Fortunately, the student managed to cast the counter-spell and end the blizzard before it greatly disrupted Christmas. Charlie Weasley planned to return to The Burrow for Christmas in 1986, but got injured when decorating a Christmas tree in the Great Hall. Jacob's sibling helped Zonkos with some deliveries to repay Charlie's debt, and they made a holiday blancmange together to thank Professor Snape for managing Hogwarts and taking care of Charlie during his recovery."

Xenophilius Lovegood, the editor of the highly controversial tabloid newspaper The Quibbler, as well as his daughter Luna, subscribed to this conspiracy theory, believing that there were a number of disaffected Ministry officials - Aurors among them - that had banded together and conspired to destroy the wizarding governing body from within. Luna explained the conspiracy to Harry Potter, Horace Slughorn, Sybill Trelawney and Severus Snape at a Christmas party after Harry said that he wanted to become an Auror; Luna advised him not to because of the supposed conspiracy."

She watched apprehensively behind Hermione and Ronald Weasley, and applauded happily after Harry flew the Hippogriff.

In the 1920s, the New Salem Philanthropic Society, a fanatical No-Maj group looking to expose and destroy wizards and witches, called themselves the \"Second Salemers.\" The book The Scars of Salem: Essays on the Witch Trials of 1692 contained a collection of essays on the Salem Witch Trials and their lasting impact on the American wizarding community. Tina Goldstein, for instance, used the names of Deliverance Dane and Mercy Lewis on two separate occasions in December 1926 (in both cases expressing her exasperation with Newt Scamander).

  "summary": "A Quidditch pitch was the area where a Quidditch match took place, typically in the shape of an oval, five hundred feet long and a hundred and eighty feet wide, with a small central circle of approximately two feet in diameter. The early barrel-goals had been replaced by baskets on stilts, but whilst these were practical, they did carry an inherent problem: there was no size restriction on the baskets, which differed dramatically from pitch to pitch. By 1620, scoring areas had been added at each end of the pitch, and an additional rule in the game dictated that only one Chaser was allowed in these areas at any given time. In addition, the size of the baskets themselves had reduced considerably, although there was still a certain amount of variation between pitches. At the time of the introduction of the Golden Snitch, a standard Quidditch pitch consisted of an elongated oval playing area five hundred feet long and a hundred and eighty feet wide. It had a small circle at the centre, approximately two feet in diameter, from which all the balls were released at the start of the game. Because Quidditch is an aerial sport, Quidditch pitches usually feature spectator seating at high vantage points, whether in towers (such as at Hogwarts) or in a fully-encircling platform style (such as the British stadium that held the 1994 Quidditch World Cup). The advice of Mumps must not, historically, have always been followed as, in 1362, the Wizards' Council outlawed playing Quidditch within fifty miles of a known Muggle town."

When it eventually became a school, the house kept expanding until it became a castle. Ilvermorny was founded in 1627, 637 years after Hogwarts, and the school was originally just a rough shack containing two teachers and two students. Ilvermorny was originally a stone house constructed by Irish immigrant Isolt Sayre, and her No-Maj husband James Steward.

Thus, the school started with just the couple acting as teachers and their two adopted sons, Chadwick and Webster Boot, as students.

He often carried it for protection when making trips into the Forbidden Forest, such as in spring of 1992 when he took Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Draco to help look for an injured unicorn. He answered the door with it in May 1993 when Harry and Ron went to visit him after Hermione was Petrified by a Basilisk. In 1995, he was carrying it when Albus Dumbledore asked him to go and fetch Igor Karkaroff after Viktor Krum was attacked. He also had it in the spring of 1996 when he took Harry and Hermione to meet his half-brother, Grawp. On 1 March 1997, he carried it with him into the Hospital Wing to visit Ron after he was mistakenly poisoned. It was broken shortly thereafter when Hagrid briefly lost his temper at Harry's repeated accusations against Professor Snape."

Years later, Rakepick attempted to enter the vault again, this time with Jacob's sibling, Merula Snyde, Ben Copper, Bill Weasley and either Penny Haywood or Charlie Weasley. Jacob's sibling used Garrotting Gas, which they had received from Severus Snape the previous year, to stop Rakepick. After a brief reunion, Jacob left after Rakepick, and the students managed to get back to Hogwarts using a portrait of the castle."

In addition to sleeping in the cupboard and keeping his possessions, it also served as a place for the Dursleys to punish Harry every time he accidentally unleashed some magic. On one occasion, Aunt Petunia gave Harry an awful haircut, but his hair grew back quickly the next day, resulting in Harry getting a week in his cupboard. Uncle Vernon threatened Harry that he would be in the cupboard from June until Christmas, but after the escape of the boa constrictor on Dudley's 11th birthday, Harry got a lengthy punishment in the cupboard until the summer holidays. The Dursleys' fears about Harry being\u00a0magical turned out to be correct, as Harry received an invitation to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991. From 1992 onwards, Harry slept in Dudley's second bedroom and the cupboard was used by the Dursleys to store Harry's magical possessions while he was staying with them during the summer holidays, until the Dursleys learned of Sirius Black's existence, and no longer made Harry hide his things there. In 1997, as Harry left 4 Privet Drive for the last time, he took a look inside the cupboard, which was now being used to store stacked shoes and umbrellas."

However, Mundungus Fletcher believed he would be able to remove the engraving on the Black family's goblin-wrought silver goblets, although he never actually did so. Goblin-wrought silver was likely extremely valuable, as the notoriously tight-fisted\u00a0Caractacus Burke considered 500 Galleons a fair price for a suit of armour made from it, and even then he was rebuffed.

Enchanting the statues from the Fountain of Magical Brethren to protect Harry, immobilise Bellatrix, and warn important Ministry officials, Dumbledore proceeded to take on the Dark Lord. Voldemort responded by Apparating near the fountain pool and firing a curse at Dumbledore, which Dumbledore easily dodged by Disapparating and Apparating by the fountain. After Voldemort missed Dumbledore, Dumbledore then sent a powerful spell at Voldemort, one which the Dark Lord was forced to block with a Silver shield; the spell did not harm the shield, but made a deep gong-like sound as it was deflected. Voldemort realised from the non-lethal nature of the spell that Dumbledore never meant to kill him, and, surprised, tried once again to kill Dumbledore; this time, the animated centaur statue intercepted the curse and was destroyed. The snake served as an attack and as a distraction for Voldemort to Disapparate and Apparate in the middle of the fountain, sending another Killing Curse at Dumbledore. Simultaneously, Dumbledore caused the snake to vanish before enchanting the water from the fountain to surround Voldemort like a sphere of molten glass. After a brief pause where Dumbledore showed his first sign of alarm during the duel, Voldemort attempted to possess Harry, in the hopes that Dumbledore would sacrifice his pupil to kill the Dark Lord."

During Fudge's time in office, the Atrium's layout did not change until the later part of his last year in office, when he was using all his power and influence to discredit Dumbledore and Harry. To reinforce his position as Minister, Fudge had a large magical portrait banner of himself hanging in the Atrium. Subliminally, it represented that Fudge's presence was felt everywhere in the Ministry and as a warning against those who might challenge his, and by extension the Ministry's, position that You-Know-Who had not truly returned. On the 18th June, 1996, the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, fought between five members of the Order of the Phoenix and a group of Death Eaters, culminated in a duel between Albus Dumbledore and Lord Voldemort. The two master wizards cast at each other spells of such a powerful and destructive calibre, that many parts of the Atrium, including the banner of Fudge, were destroyed. The layout of the Atrium during Voldemort's reign was still generally the same, except that it was somewhat darker than before and instead of the Fountain of Magical Brethren, there was a black stone statue of a witch and wizard sitting on thrones, which was made from the bodies of contorted Muggle men, women, and children, all with stupid-looking faces. The fountain featured golden statues of a wizard, a witch, a centaur, a goblin, and a house-elf, all which spouted water from various locales into the pool of water below, and each of the last three of which was shown in some manner basking in the generosity, wisdom and apparent superiority of wizardkind. To enter the lifts allowing access to the rest of the Ministry (tenth floor excepted), visitors passed through a set of golden gates, beside which was a security stand."

As this hearing took place amid the Ministry of Magic's attempts to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter, there was some bias against Harry's case in hopes to expel the boy and stop him from claiming Lord Voldemort had returned, and Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge was determined to convict Harry for this crime. However, after Albus Dumbledore's intervention, the expulsion was retracted and changed to a disciplinary hearing which would take place ten days later, on 12 August at 9 am, at the British Ministry of Magic's headquarters, before the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement Amelia Bones was in her office. Cornelius Fudge, then-Minister for Magic, was attempting to discredit Harry and Dumbledore's claims about the return of Lord Voldemort, and so he changed the hearing to an earlier time (8 am) and a different location (Courtroom Ten) in the hopes of making Harry miss it, as well as trying Harry in front of the entire Wizengamot. It was later revealed that Dolores Umbridge, a Ministry bureaucrat who served as Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic and one of Harry's prosecutors during the hearing, had secretly ordered the Dementors to attack Harry in the first place. During the hearing, Fudge was incredibly biased against Harry, in the hopes to spitefully discredit and expel the boy for his claims that Lord Voldemort had returned."

The phrase \"Magic is Might\" was inscribed at the bottom of the statue, thus, the statue became a symbol of the Pure-blood supremacist ideals of the new regime and the detestation of Muggles, which were considered inferior. It was presumably replaced by another statue after Lord Voldemort's defeat in May 1998 and the subsequent reform of the Ministry spearheaded by the new Minister, Kingsley Shacklebolt."

A notable exception to these unwritten rules was the fabled Cloak of Invisibility, a Deathly Hallow that never seemed to waver in its ability and resisted spells, despite its immense age. Invisibility cloaks had existed since the 13th century, with typical invisibility cloaks having been available since at least the 20th century. Alastor Moody owned two invisibility cloaks, lending ones to Mundungus Fletcher and Sturgis Podmore.

On 24 June 1995, Harry Potter was afflicted with this venom when he suffered a bite to the leg from an Acromantula in the Triwizard Maze, though Fawkes healed the injury with his Phoenix tears. Seeing how Harry did not suffer any ill-effects during his trial in the maze and the Little Hangleton graveyard, the venom may be largely harmless.

After Hepzibah revealed her two greatest treasures during one of Tom's visits to her home, Tom killed her and used her death to make the cup into a Horcrux. Before Hokey died, Albus Dumbledore realised the mistake and obtained a true memory from her, but it only showed that Riddle had enquired about Hepzibah's artefacts and was not enough to prove Hokey was innocent before she died. Hepzibah claimed to be descended from Helga Hufflepuff, one of the founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Two of her most prized possessions were a cup that belonged to her (claimed) ancestor, Helga Hufflepuff, and a locket that belonged to Salazar Slytherin, the latter of which she bought at great expense from Caractacus Burke. While Riddle was visiting her on behalf of Mr Burke, ostensibly to negotiate the sale of a suit of goblin-made armour in her possession, she imprudently showed him two of her greatest treasures: Hufflepuff's cup and Slytherin's locket.

This textbook was used as an introduction to Transfiguration for young witches and wizards, it contained basic transformation spells. It was a required textbook and as such was on the list of items needed by first years for Transfiguration classes in 1991 and 1992 for first and second-year students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Before Ginny Weasley's first year at Hogwarts, Lucius Malfoy managed to slip Tom Riddle's diary into her second-hand copy of the book in Flourish and Blotts, leading to the re-opening of the Chamber of Secrets in that term. Do not wiggle or twirl your wand unnecessarily, or the Transfiguration will certainly be unsuccessful. Incomplete Transfigurations are difficult to put right, but you must attempt to do so."

  "summary": "He was the third child and youngest son of a Muggle father and a witch mother, and was raised alongside an older brother and sister. The only one of the two boys to possess magical ability, Daniel nevertheless attended a Muggle primary school prior to receiving his letter of acceptance from Hogwarts. While apparently loving, Daniel's childhood were still marred by controversy from an early age, marked by the illicit activities of their father and, in due time, also Daniel's older brother Reggie, who was a Squib. Having \"tried to help\" using magic but only ended up \"scaring a bunch of Muggles\", Daniel's mother was also apprehended. While her two apparent accomplices were both tried and sentenced to a Muggle prison, her violation of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy came to the attention of the Ministry of Magic, which, presumably through the efforts of the Muggle Liaison Office, successfully claimed jurisdiction and had her released into the custody of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. The family's arrest was covered by a Muggle newspaper, dubbing them \"The Bloody Pages\", after which Daniel, who was now left in the care of his older sister, found school to be anything but fun. Following his mother's imprisonment after her violation of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, he grew to view it as a \"stupid law\", and expressed the belief that while they should not necessarily go around flaunting their abilities to the masses, he nevertheless believed that keeping magic from the Muggle world entirely as a selfish thing to do, apparently blind to the extent to which permitting magic around non-wizards could be exploited for nefarious purposes."

In the aftermath of the arrest of Percival Graves in the New York subway in 1926, Newton Scamander used the Revelio Charm to reveal that it was actually the Dark Wizard Gellert Grindelwald, who had used Human Transfiguration to take the appearance of the MACUSA official. In Harry Potter's first Transfiguration class in 1991, Professor Minerva McGonagall Transfigured her desk into a pig, and the pig back to a desk. In 1994, Remus Lupin and Sirius Black changed Peter Pettigrew from a rat back into his usual human appearance, during the Encounter at the Shrieking Shack. At the start of the 1994\u20131995 school year at Hogwarts, when the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Barty Crouch Jnr (disguised as Alastor Moody) Transfigured Draco Malfoy into a ferret on the Marble Staircase, Minerva McGonagall Transfigured him back into a human. In 1996, Albus Dumbledore had to Untransfigure Horace Slughorn after Slughorn had transformed himself into an armchair, whilst he was hiding in a Muggle house in Budleigh Babberton from the Death Eaters."

 "vanishing cabinet": {

  "summary": "The cabinets seemed to ward off all known defensive spells, as they were successfully used to transport several Death Eaters from Borgin and Burkes into Hogwarts School, and Graham Montague was able to apparate into Hogwarts despite the protection spells of the school normally preventing such an action. Vanishing Cabinets were highly popular during the First Wizarding War; in the event of a Death Eater attack, one could simply disappear to the other cabinet until the danger had passed. During the First Wizarding War, numerous witches and wizards used Vanishing Cabinets to anonymously disappear if the Death Eaters visited. In 1992, when Harry accidentally arrived to Borgin and Burkes via Floo Powder, he hid inside the Cabinet without fully closing the door, to avoid Borgin, Lucius, and Draco Malfoy. Two months later, Peeves damaged the Cabinet at Hogwarts in when he was persuaded by Nearly Headless Nick to drop it in a classroom right above Filch's office to get Harry out of trouble with Filch. In 1996, Fred and George Weasley shoved Graham Montague headfirst into the broken cabinet on the first floor of Hogwarts when he tried to take points away from them. The Hogwarts Vanishing Cabinet was later moved to the Room of Requirement and in 1997, Draco Malfoy successfully repaired it to allow a group of Death Eaters, including Fenrir Greyback, to enter Hogwarts from the Borgin and Burkes Vanishing Cabinet, to accomplish his plot to assassinate Albus Dumbledore. During the Battle of Hogwarts, when Vincent Crabbe released Fiendfyre in the Room of Requirement, likely the Vanishing Cabinet was destroyed, along with many other artefacts hidden there. During the Calamity which affected the Wizarding world in the 2010s, Vanishing Cabinets were among the various magical items which appeared as Foundables in the world. If one cabinet was broken, a transferred object was trapped in a kind of limbo; repairing it seemed to be a very difficult task, as Draco Malfoy spent an entire school year with instructions from Borgin to accomplish, otherwise a simple Mending Charm (or something similar) would have been sufficient."

Neville Longbottom proved unable to perform a Switching Spell by October 1994, a fact that was criticised by Minerva McGonagall, who called the spell \"simple\". In preparation for the first task of the Triwizard Tournament, Hermione Granger idly suggested to Harry Potter that he might use this spell on a dragon to turn its fangs to wine-gums, but rejected the idea as impractical because as a rule it was nearly impossible to cast a spell through a dragon's hide. In 1996, Harry Potter forgot the definition of a Switching Spell when doing his written Transfiguration Ordinary Wizarding Level exam."

The Casual Vacancy is set in the fictional location of Pagford, a seemingly peaceful and idyllic town that is home to a cobbled market square and an ancient abbey. However, beneath its surface, Pagford is a \"town at war\", where rich clash with poor, teenagers with parents, wives with their husbands, and teachers with their students. After the sudden death of Barry Fairbrother shocks the town, his seat on the parish council is left open, leading to an election \"fraught with passion, duplicity and unexpected revelations\". Publisher Little, Brown and Company described the novel as \"blackly comic, thought-provoking and constantly surprising\". The Casual Vacancy was published worldwide by Little, Brown and Company on 27 September, 2012 in hardback, e-book, audio download, and CD formats. The title was  promoted with a \"minimalist\" approach, with few advance copies being released (similar to later Harry Potter releases) with few appearances by Rowling herself and only one appearance in the United States well in advance of its release. Early reviews were  generally favourable, but noted its vast difference from the Harry Potter novels, including elements such as drugs, sex, and explicit language."

As Muggle technology did not work properly on the school grounds, it is possible that these lessons either took place somewhere else, or that the computers kept at the school had been modified as to be powered by magic rather than electricity.

This made Hermione Granger furious; while Ron Weasley, her fellow Prefect, refused to interfere, Hermione immediately told the twins and Lee off for experimenting on unsuspecting children. George and Lee tried to reassure her that it was not dangerous, while Fred claimed it was fine since they had paid their subjects, but Hermione insisted that they stop. Fred and George initially scoffed at her attempt to stop them, but immediately backed down when she threatened to tell their mother.

The club motto was \"We shall conquer\" until 1972, the same year that they played in the International Quidditch Tournament, when it was changed to \"Let's all just keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best\". In 1931, the Cannons won the Josef Wronski Award for Excellent Pitch Skills. In 1972, the team played in the International Quidditch Tournament and changed their official motto. In around 1987, the Chudley Cannons lost a game. In August 1992, the Cannons were ninth in the League. In 1998, the Appleby Arrows defeated the Chudley Cannons in the summer, aided by a pathetic performance by Cannon's Seeker Galvin Gudgeon. In 1999, the Chudley Cannons broke a sixteen-game losing streak by drawing with the Caerphilly Catapults."

Sometimes, Native American witches and wizards were accepted members of their respective tribes, even attaining positions of prominence and respect as medicine men or skilled hunters. To prevent themselves from being outed, unscrupulous No-Maj medicine men who were faking magical powers circulated malicious rumours about Animagi, and thus the false belief that people gained the ability to transform into an animal by sacrificing their own kin became widespread among Native Americans. In reality, however, most Native American Animagi used their powers to avoid persecution or hunt for their tribe."

The human victims could not move into other frames unlike the dragon, that guarded the vault, which was able to break out of the frames inside the vault without the curse being broken beforehand. While trapped in a portrait, the victim did not age or change in any way and, upon being freed from the curse, emerged from the portrait not a day older than when they were first trapped, as demonstrated by Jacob, who did not look any different from when his younger sibling saw him last, to which he replied; \"Well, I've been trapped in a portrait for years...\" The curse appeared to get stronger over time with victims apparently no longer having to touch the frame, like Beatrice, to get trapped inside. Interestingly, however, victims trapped inside the vault appear to be better sustained than those outside the vault, as Beatrice was more affected by the ordeal within a school year in the portrait on the Grand Staircase than Jacob had been after several years spent trapped inside the vault. In the 1988\u20131989 school year, Beatrice Haywood and several other students became trapped inside portraits on the Grand Staircase as the result of this powerful and malign curse being somehow unleashed after a cloaked figure was seen moving the portraits."

The wand was stolen by Isolt Sayre from her aunt Gormlaith Gaunt in 1620, when the young girl fled to the New world aboard the Mayflower. During the 10th Century, Salazar Slytherin, one of the founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, decided to make his own unique wand of Snakewood with the core of a Basilisk horn, a dangerous giant snake that was bred by Salazar himself and who lived in a hidden secret room at Hogwarts. The creator gave this unique wand the ability to sleep and to wake up again when instructed by speaking Parseltongue to it, a rare gift that gave one the ability to speak with snakes, and a trait that was passed on through Slytherin's family. After Salazar Slytherin's death, the secret had been handed over through the centuries to each member of Slytherin's family who possessed this wand. Gormlaith used the wand to burn down the cottage of the Sayre family that tragically killed Gormaith's sister and her husband, saving her niece Isolt Sayre out of the fire to raise her at her own, with the hope that she can bring Isolt back to the \u2018right way'."

Ron had a slug-vomiting attack from an earlier backfired charm, and got Tom Riddle 's trophy all covered with slug and slime, resulting in him having to clean it repeatedly.

For instance, it is unknown if Half-goblins can use Polyjuice Potion as this particular potion is designed for human transformations only, and therefore does not work on other beings. However, because the potion is known to be effective on Part-Veelas, if their Veela ancestry goes back at least two generations, it is possible that Part-Goblins (and Part-Giants) whose ancestry goes further back than their direct parentage could use this potion. On the other hand, the only known part-goblin, Filius Flitwick, is trained in the human magical arts, as shown by his carrying a wand, having attended Hogwarts and teaching there. This proves that part-goblins are allowed to carry wands and perform wand magic, and are not covered by the Wand Ban that forbids full goblins from using wands, though they would be capable of it."

Harry Potter came across a dozen wizards and witches creating hundreds of the pamphlets when he, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger infiltrated the Ministry in September of 1997. This was partly because one of the manufacturers asked a fellow employee if \"the old hag\" would be \"interrogating Mudbloods all day\", and partly because the scars on the back of his hand, caused by his many punishments by Umbridge in his fifth year, \"seemed to tingle\" as he read the front of the pamphlet. Its dissemination was part of a larger effort to discriminate against Muggle-borns, which included requiring them to register with the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, stripping them of their wands and jobs, imprisoning them in Azkaban for supposedly stealing magic, and teaching anti-Muggle and Muggle-born propaganda at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which also did not allow any Muggle-born students."

He travelled to the Potters' home in Godric's Hollow and murdered James and Lily Potter, whom died protecting infant Harry. When he attempted to murder Harry, Lily's loving sacrifice allowed Harry to live and rebounded Voldemort's Killing Curse. It also sealed Harry's fate as the 'Boy Who Lived', via a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead and the fact that he was now the only known survivor of the Killing Curse. Early in 1980, Sybill Trelawney met Albus Dumbledore in the Hog's Head to interview for the Divination professorship at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Immediately, Snape took everything he had heard to Voldemort, who decided that the boy was Harry Potter, although it could very well have been Neville Longbottom."

  "summary": "While some were used to detect lying, some were to uncover concealment, or even when Dark Wizards or one's enemies were around, they were all unique in their shared ability to interact and improve upon each other when made to work together; a trait no other magical artefact was known to possess. However, those experienced in their use still tended to advise those who were not against relying on them too much, as they could be fooled. They were used by Barty Crouch Jr when he was impersonating Moody using Polyjuice Potion during the 1994\u20131995 school year at Hogwarts. When Dumbledore's Army was formed in 1995, there were various Dark Detectors in the Room of Requirement when it served as the D.A. In 1997 Hermione gave him a new one for his Birthday, as his old one was cracked and worn out. Following the outbreak of The Calamity and the subsequent establishment of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force in the late 2010s, the British Ministry of Magic supplied members of said department with modified Dark Detectors, which had been \"re-purposed\" and \"attuned\" to find hidden Traces created by the Calamity."

  "summary": "One night, Corvus Lestrange put Laurena Kama under the Imperius Curse to lure her away from her family. Yusuf Kama, son of Laurena Kama and Mustafa Kama, swore an Unbreakable Vow to kill young Corvus and end the Lestrange lineage as revenge for the abduction of his mother. In an attempt to protect his son, Lestrange sent both him and his daughter Leta to America along with his servant Irma Dugard. Yusuf mistakenly believed Credence Barebone to be Corvus Lestrange (along with much of the rest of the wizarding world), as he was unaware that a young Leta had switched Corvus in his crib with Aurelius Dumbledore, and attempted to resolve his vow by killing Credence. After his death, Corvus Lestrange's remains were interred at the Lestrange Mausoleum, at the Cimeti\u00e8re du P\u00e8re-Lachaise, in Paris, his grand marble tomb dominating the many sarcophagi there. From what is known of his history, Corvus (IV) seemed to be a cold-hearted man who was not above using dark magic or forcing a woman into marriage. He did not love his daughter Leta or Clarisse Tremblay, but loved his son, possibly because Corvus V's birth meant the future survival of his family line."

  "summary": "Once made, the vial was supposedly impossible to destroy, though Albus Dumbledore was willing to try to destroy the one he had once made with Gellert Grindelwald. During their teenage years, Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald made a blood pact where they swore an oath never to fight each other - presumably as a fail-safe to ensure no rift were to set them apart in their grand endeavour to ignite the revolution between the magical and the non-magical aggregations wherein the former was intended to prevail in the end to mark an era of sovereignty over the latter, with Albus and Gellert spearheading it equally as unified leaders with neither wizard lesser or greater than the other. By 1927, Grindelwald still possessed the vial from this pact to protect it from Dumbledore, so that Dumbledore would not be able to ever attack him directly. However, the pact worked both ways and was therefore a double-edged sword, as while it protected Grindelwald from Dumbledore, it also prevented Grindelwald himself from personally eliminating Dumbledore, the greatest threat to his cause. It nevertheless served Grindelwald well by leaving Grindelwald personally undefeatable at the hands of Dumbledore but knowing fully well Dumbledore may still be capable of interfering in his revolution, he searched for a way to kill his rival should he act against his army. Eventually, Grindelwald discovered the extremely powerful Obscurus, Credence Barebone, who was the only one potentially capable of killing Dumbledore, and so planned to use him as a weapon against his rival. However, the terms of the pact would not stop Dumbledore from finally defeating Grindelwald many years later in 1945."

  "summary": "Educational Decree Number Twenty-Six was passed by Dolores Umbridge, then-Hogwarts High Inquisitor on 14 January, 1996 to prevent the teachers from discussing the mass breakout from Azkaban that had occurred the day before. As the teachers were apprehensive about this Decree, the students made it the object of many jokes; Lee Jordan quoted the Decree to Umbridge when she told off Fred and George Weasley for playing Exploding Snap in her Defence Against the Dark Arts class. Harry Potter felt rather furious at this new decree, as it proved that Umbridge was not the least persuaded by the Azkaban breakout of Voldemort's return, but instead she continues to undermine the Order of the Phoenix's attempt to get the message out. The teachers were forbidden from praising Harry Potter directly for his interview in The Quibbler due to this Decree, but they circumvented this by awarding him with other means, Professor Sprout by awarding Gryffindor House twenty points for simply passing a watering can, Professor Flitwick gave him a box of Sugar Mice, and Professor Trelawney diverged from her usual prediction of Harry's death by claiming that he would live long with twelve children and become the Minister for Magic. Additionally, once students began making trouble en masse following Umbridge's appointment as Headmistress, the teachers did not trouble to help Umbridge, with Flitwick stating that he could have gotten rid of Fred and George's fireworks, but he was not sure whether he had the authority. The decree was abolished after Dolores Umbridge's suspension from her post of High Inquisitor and Albus Dumbledore's return to his post of Headmaster, following the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in the spring of 1996."

  "summary": "This\u00a0was a spell (incantation unknown), which could\u00a0be used by a witch or wizard to implant a false memory into their victim's mind, without the victim realising it was not originally theirs. However, while he attempted to use the true memory to secure Morfin's release from Azkaban (and failed as Morfin died before he could be exonerated), Hokey's memory was insufficient to prove her innocence. Later that same year, Tom Riddle\u00a0may have used the spell to make Harry Potter believe his godfather Sirius Black was being tortured by him in the Department of Mysteries. However, it was possible that Voldemort simply created an image in Harry's mind through his tight Occlumens connection with Harry (due to the Horcrux connection)\u00a0so that Harry would see what Voldemort's imagination dreamt up. It may have been up to Harry whether or not to believe it, since he was persuaded by Hermione to check to see whether Sirius is really in the Department of Mysteries (not in Grimmauld Place). Voldemort was relying, therefore, on Harry's concern for Sirius's safety to get him to come, just as he was sure Harry would come to him in the Forbidden Forest during the break in the Battle of Hogwarts. It is possible that Professor Horace Slughorn used this in the next school year to hide his memory of Voldemort asking him about Horcruxes, although as he retained awareness of the true memory his spell may be a different one. It is also possible that he simply repressed it to such a degree that it could not be extracted from him against his will, as the memory he gave Dumbledore simple went blank at the right times and was replaced by a disembodied shouting, rather than images; this was noted to be crudely done. Hermione Granger used this in 1997 to make her parents believe they were named Wendell and Monica Wilkins respectively, that they had no children, and to make them move to Australia in order to protect them from Voldemort and his Death Eaters."

It is unknown when exactly this particular dragon was placed to guard the vaults it was assigned, but it is known that during this time it was trained to fear the sound of the Clankers as it expected pain upon hearing it, causing it to retreat and allow those who were using the Clankers to access the vaults. In 1991, when Rubeus Hagrid talked to Harry about Gringotts (the first time), he told him rumours about there being dragons guarding Gringotts vaults. As Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione had been planning to break into the Lestrange Vault for a few weeks ahead of time, they fully expected to find the dragon and were able to use the Clankers (with the help of Imperiused goblin Bogrod) to drive it away and get into the vault.

In order to get all the magic, he needs to gather all the witches and wizards in the world, so he forms the Brigade of Witch-Hunters, armed with packs of wild dogs. No real wizards or witches respond, but a Muggle pretends to be a wizard, and offers to teach him, despite not knowing any magic himself. Soon, the Muggle teacher demands money and treasures for his services, and he hides all these objects in his small house. Babbitty, the king's washer woman, hides and watches the Muggle as he pulls two twigs from a tree and later pretends these are wands. While the king and the Muggle are practising, they hear Babbitty laughing hysterically from her cottage. This enrages the King, who demands that the Muggle help him perform in front of his subjects to show off his new abilities. The Muggle tries to back out by saying he has to go out of town, and cannot help him, but the King threatens to send the Brigade of Witch-Hunters after him, and if anyone laughs while the King is performing, the Muggle will be beheaded. The Muggle heads to Babbitty's house, where he spies on her, and finds out that she is a real witch.

During the 1994 tournament, an age restriction was added and as such, an Age Line was cast to ensure that no one under the minimum age could try to put their name into the goblet. Anyone who tried to do so with an Ageing Potion would end up hit with its flames and forced them to age even further as old men, as demonstrated by what happened to Fred and George Weasley when they tried to trick the goblet via that exact method. Since the goblet is a highly powerful magical artefact, it would require a Confundus Charm of equal or greater power to accomplish. As many who knew about the Triwizard Tournament were unaware of its use in the competition in 1994, it had either been created rather recently, or so long ago that it was long-forgotten by the time it was unveiled once again in 1994. Albus Dumbledore drew an Age Line around the Goblet during the 1994 Tournament to prevent students under the age of seventeen from entering their name. However, the Goblet was fooled into thinking there were more than three schools competing by a powerful Confundus Charm cast on it by Barty Crouch Jnr, disguised as Alastor Moody."

In 1991, Harry Potter went to the staffroom looking for Professor Snape to get his copy of Quidditch Through the Ages back and saw Argus Filch bandaging up Snape's leg from being bitten by Fluffy. Later that year, in 1992, Hermione was stationed outside the staffroom to keep an eye on Snape, but when he came out asking what she was doing there her excuse was that she was waiting for Professor Flitwick. The night that Ginny was taken into the Chamber of Secrets, Professor Lockhart had fallen asleep in the staffroom. In 1993, Professor Lupin held the Third years first Defence Against the Dark Arts class in the staffroom. In 1995, Dobby overheard Professor McGonagall and \"Professor Moody\" in the staffroom discussing the second task of the Triwizard Tournament, which gave Dobby the idea to give Harry gillyweed.

  "summary": "It's also supposed to be released in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany. In her adult novel, the unexpected death of a member of the parish council and the ensuing election sparks a war among a small town's residents. Press materials have called the book \"blackly comic,\" while The New Yorker called the description of one family \"ostentatiously unremitting: drugs, prostitution, the stink of diapers.\" Check these reviews out:\n\u201cThe Casual Vacancy will certainly sell, and it may also be liked. There are many nice touches, including Rowling\u2019s portrait of the social worker\u2019s gutless boyfriend, who relishes how, in an argument with a lover, you can 'obscure an emotional issue by appearing to seek precision.' The book\u2019s political philosophy is generous, even if its analysis of class antagonisms is perhaps no more elaborate than that of Caddyshack. And, as the novel turns darker, toward a kind of Thomas Hardy finale, it hurtles along impressively. But whereas Rowling\u2019s shepherding of readers was, in the Harry Potter series, an essential asset, in The Casual Vacancy her firm hand can feel constraining. She leaves little space for the peripheral or the ambiguous; hidden secrets are labeled as hidden secrets, and events are easy to predict. -- Ian Parker of The New Yorker\n\"So look, here's the thing: This."

When Bob Ogden, in the course of his duties as Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad, visited the Gaunt Shack in Little Hangleton to interview Morfin Gaunt about hexing a local Muggle (her boyfriend), Cecilia and Tom rode on a grey horse past the house. The two gossiped at the ruined cottage, Cecilia asking Tom to tear down the hovel. Later, when Ogden ran from the house to escape Morfin Gaunt's hexes, he knocked into Tom and Cecilia's horse, making the couple laugh at him for his bumbling and silly clothing. Presumably, Cecilia lost contact with the Riddle family after Tom married Merope. Cecilia seemed to be snobbish and rude, more so than Tom Riddle, as she was very impolite and critical when talking about the Gaunt family house. He seemed to have an affectionate relationship with her, calling her darling, and comforting her when seeing Morfin's dead snake nailed to the door. The name \"Cecilia\" is the Latinate feminine form of the Roman family name Caecilius, which was derived from Latin caecus \"blind\"."

  "summary": "A short-lived series of private lessons took place after Christmas in the 1995\u20131996 school year, during which Severus Snape attempted to teach Harry Potter the skill of Occlumency. The lessons began under the insistence of Albus Dumbledore, who believed that Harry's mind was vulnerable to an attack by Lord Voldemort, and so the class was designed to give Harry protection from this type of mind invasion. This was to prevent other people from finding out about Harry and Voldemort's connection in their minds (or as the Ministry put it at that time, Harry seeing things), least of all by Dolores Umbridge. Harry told his best friends Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger about the lessons, despite Snape forbidding him from telling anyone else the truth. Dumbledore himself refused to teach Harry for the fear of leaving an opening for Voldemort to attack the headmaster, though Snape took it as the headmaster having the right to delegate less-enjoyable tasks to other teachers. Sirius Black was rather displeased with Snape being the teacher, and warned him not to abuse Harry, while Remus Lupin was confident due to Snape's mastery in Occlumency, and encouraged Harry to try his hardest. Under Snape's tutelage, Harry repeatedly had his mind broken into in order to train him. Unfortunately, due to the mutual animosity between the teacher and student, Snape was unkind and discouraging in his methods despite his own mastery of the skill, while Harry did not take Snape's lessons too seriously, and neglected to practise. Unenthusiastic though both were, Snape was nonetheless disappointed with Harry's lack of progress and efforts, as Snape himself had to give up his evenings for these trainings, and would scold Harry viciously for negligence. In order to prevent Harry from seeing into his mind via any potential backlash, Snape borrowed Dumbledore's Pensieve, and placed his memories into it before each lesson."

 "regeneration potion": {
  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Regeneration_potion",
  "summary": "The potion required a cauldron large enough for a grown man to sit in, as well as three crucial ingredients: bone unknowingly taken from the Dark Wizard's father, flesh - of an amount about as large as a person's hand - willingly sacrificed from one of his servants, and the blood forcibly extracted from one of his foes - though it would appear that the blood had to be freshly taken from the source, meaning that the enemy of the one to be revived by the potion must have been there as prerequisite for its preparation. As Voldemort noted the potion to be \"an old piece of dark magic\", it can be inferred that it had been used by other Dark Wizards who suffered bodily damage; perhaps, even, by previous makers of Horcruxes. While Voldemort had the flesh at hand due to Wormtail's presence and could easily gain access to his father's bone from his grave, he wanted Harry Potter's blood to rise \"greater and more terrible\" than before his fall; he rejected the usage of any other wizard's blood for this reason, despite Wormtail's repeated attempts to persuade him to accelerate the rebirth process, and that there were plenty of enemies for them to capture. With the three ingredients, Voldemort's rudimentary form was included into the cauldron, and he was able to regain his new body. The use of Harry's blood in the potion, however, would come to be a mistake as it prevented Voldemort from killing Harry because the blood passed Lily Potter's protection to Voldemort and anchored Harry to the living world through him, ensuring the Dark Lord's defeat three years later. Voldemort believed, out of his lack of understanding love, that by using Harry's blood, it would allow him to bypass Lily's protection and thereby enable him to circumvent what the boy has which robbed him of power years ago, when in fact it actually strengthened it."

  "summary": "It was sometimes used as a sentence for criminals by the British Ministry of Magic, and was considered a fate worse than death. Before Lord Voldemort was in control of the Ministry, the Dementor's Kiss was ordinarily used against those who escaped from Azkaban. When Kingsley Shacklebolt became Minister for Magic after the end of the Second Wizarding War in 1998, Dementors were no longer used by the Ministry of Magic. When the Dementor's Kiss was performed, the Dementor would pull back its hood, clamp its jaw around the victim's mouth, and consume their soul. The Dementor's Kiss was occasionally imposed as a sentence for criminals by the British Ministry of Magic; as the reformed Ministry stopped employing Dementors as guards of Azkaban after the Second Wizarding War, the Dementor's Kiss was no longer used as a criminal sentence either. This fact and the fact that even very serious criminals (such as Bellatrix Lestrange) were not sentenced to it, suggest that it may have been reserved for the crime of escaping from Azkaban. The Dementors attempted to Kiss Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Sirius Black after cornering them by the Black Lake in 1994."

Phoenix feather wands were always the pickiest when it comes to potential owners, for the creature from which they are taken was one of the most independent and detached in the world. In Ollivanders wand shop, the owner Garrick Ollivander was known to use phoenix feathers as one of his three cores, the others being dragon heartstring and unicorn hair. Harry Potter's and Tom Riddle's wand cores came from the same phoenix: Fawkes, who belonged to Albus Dumbledore.

This curse appeared to lose power if cast non-verbally, even by a wizard as powerful as Antonin Dolohov, and Hermione was noted to have only survived because the incantation wasn't spoken. Antonin Dolohov used the curse twice during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, first against Hermione Granger, who was knocked unconscious but survived. Dolohov might have killed Hermione if he had been able to say the incantation, but his voice was taken by Hermione's Silencing Charm earlier in the battle and the nonverbal version of the curse was not as powerful as it normally would be. Dolohov used the curse again against Harry Potter later in the battle, but it was blunted by Harry's use of the Shield Charm. Dolohov also attempted to use the curse against Sirius Black while they were duelling during the battle, but Harry managed to hit him with a Full Body-Bind Curse before he could complete the spell. Dolohov probably wanted to use this curse when trying to capture Harry Potter in the Luchino Caffe Duel, but Hermione Granger paralysed Dolohov with the Full Body-Bind Curse before he could cast the spell. This may be the curse Dolohov used to kill Remus Lupin during the Battle of Hogwarts, as it was noted that Remus's body was peaceful-looking, and this curse was not known to cause any visible signs of damage."

In the past (pre-19th century) they were often known as fir, from Old Norse fyrre, by way of Middle English firre. The Old Norse name is still used for pines in some modern north European languages, in Danish, fyr, in Norwegian fura/fure/furu, Swedish, fura/furu, and F\u00f6hre in German, but in modern English, fir is now restricted to Fir (Abies) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga)."

He was an established wandmaker in the British wizarding community and many wizarding families preferred buying Ollivander's wands over other makers, often remarking that his were the best.

  "summary": "The Fidelius Charm (incantation unknown) was an extremely difficult, multifaceted and potent charm that could be used to conceal a secret inside an individual's soul; the witch or wizard who housed the secret was known as the Secret Keeper. When the charm was initially cast, one could choose more than one person to be Secret Keeper, though it is unknown if there was a limit as to how many people could carry the same secret in this way. Once the Secret Keeper died, all the people who had learnt the secret from them would become the new Secret Keepers. If the Keeper had chosen not to reveal the secret to anyone (so that they are the only Keepers), then the secret rested with them forever. However, it appeared that, to be eligible, one had to be capable of divulging the secret if they wished to, as this would explain why wizards did not simply bestow the secret onto creatures who could not speak a human language, or creatures such as house-elves, who could simply be ordered by their masters to not divulge the secret (as such an order would override their free will). Once the secret had been implanted, the only method for another to learn it was for the primary Secret Keeper to divulge it to that person directly; it could not be discovered any other way. The people to whom the Secret Keeper had already divulged the information (secondary Keepers) would not be able to pass it along even if they wanted to, and the information in question could not be learned even by stumbling across it, even if one were staring the secret in the face."

This massacre turned out to be a pivotal event in Wizarding history, as this was the first known mass murder that Riddle had committed. In addition, the deaths of the elder generations of the Riddle family would become the prelude of the anti-Muggle campaign that the youngest Riddle would lead as Lord Voldemort. Around 1925, Merope Gaunt, the mother of the younger Tom Riddle began to have romantic feelings for a man named Tom Riddle Senior, a Muggle who lived across town in the Riddle House.

However the Daily Prophet wrote a short column about a Fairy Nargle that was found on a pensioner's wig, possibly implying these creatures could indeed exist in the wizarding world. The eccentric British wizard Philbert Chivers desired to purchase some of this potion from Slug & Jiggers Apothecary in Diagon Alley, however the shop assistant Humphrey Balsamo instead gave him several poor quality mixtures free of charge."

Harry's bedroom was located on the second floor, close to the staircase in the living room. Following Voldemort's attack on the cottage, Harry's room was blown apart by Voldemort's backfiring killing curse. The cottage was left in its ruined state as a testament to the violence of the First Wizarding War, and to the lives lost there. James and his Muggle-born wife Lily Evans used the house as a hiding place from Lord Voldemort when he marked them and their infant son Harry for death. After James and Lily were murdered the cottage remained empty, with no one else living in it. After a prophecy was made by Sybill Trelawney concerning the birth of one who would be able to defeat Lord Voldemort, Albus Dumbledore had the Potters go into hiding after being warned of Voldemort's intentions by then-Death Eater Severus Snape."

She was also looking after Broderick Bode when he was killed by a Devil's Snare plant sent to him by the Death Eater Walden Macnair, disguised at the time as an elderly wizard. Although St Mungo's has very strict regulations of the gifts allowed into the hospital, Strout mistook the Devil Snare to be a harmless Flitterbloom and thought the improving Bode could take care of it, a dreadful mistake which cost him his life. Strout was evidently a very caring and kind-hearted witch, given her job as a Healer, meaning she specialised in tending to the both the physically and mentally unwell, in the Janus Thickey Ward. However, she was somewhat naive and inattentive in her professional duties, as she foolishly failed to identify a lethal Devil's Snare plant that had been brought into her hospital ward (mistaking it for a harmless Flitterbloom), a thoughtless mistake which resulted in her patient Broderick Bode being killed by the plant, and her being suspended from her position."

This curse would rapidly cause the death of anyone who came into contact with it, although in certain cases the spread of the curse could be slowed down by magical means. In the case of Dumbledore, this curse caused serious injury to his hand, causing it to look as if it had died, and would prove fatal in roughly one year. Regardless of the methods of delaying the spread, there was no known way of removing or completely stopping this curse, though Snape claimed that he may have been able to do more to stop the curse had Dumbledore come to him more quickly. Although removing the curse from an infected individual was seemingly impossible, it could be removed from the host object if said artefact was damaged to a certain degree. When Dumbledore used the basilisk venom-infused Sword of Gryffindor to attack the cursed ring, it destroyed the Horcrux and disabled the curse on it. After he had acquired his maternal grandfather's prized heirloom ring from his deranged uncle, Tom Riddle wore it openly during his time at Hogwarts after killing his father and grandparents. Once he learned about the effects and possibility of creating multiple Horcruxes, Riddle no longer desired to wear the ring, and instead turned it into a Horcrux with his father's murder. In the Summer of 1996, when Dumbledore found the ring under the rotting floorboards of the Gaunt shack, he saw it immediately as the Hallow that he had desired for so many years, the Resurrection Stone."

There was another corridor at this landing; like the other, it linked the tower to the main castle.

  "summary": "Unsupported flight (incantation unknown, if any) was a spell or magical technique that allowed a witch or wizard to fly without the use of a broomstick or other form of support. Levitation has been possible at least since the invention of the Levitation Spell in ancient England, and an attempt to improve upon this and achieve true flight made by Jarleth Hobart in 1544 led to the invention of the Levitation Charm. The flying broomstick, which allows wizards to fly with relative ease and convenience, was invented around 962 A.D., and seemed to satisfy most wizards' desire to fly. True, unaided flight of a human being, however, was long considered a magical impossibility, discounting any animagi whose form take on flight-able species. A rare example of a wizard flying unaided happened in 1926, when the Obscurial Credence Barebone unleashed his pent-up abilities, transforming into his Obscurus form and flying around New York. However, for obvious reasons, this was far from the secret sought by wizards, since it was impossible to control by the wizard himself and an incomparable symptom of a deadly condition. Sometime prior to 1997, Tom Riddle succeeded where most other wizards had failed and managed true flight. He first publicly demonstrated this ability during the Battle of the Seven Potters, using the spell to great effect and almost managing to defeat Harry Potter if not for an\u00a0odd reaction with their wands. Following his discovery, Riddle taught this spell to his servant Severus Snape, who used it to safely escape from Hogwarts shortly before the Battle of Hogwarts. Unsupported flight is different from levitation, which only allows objects to fly a few feet off the ground and does not work on humans."

Concerned that Jacob's sibling, whose brother had been expelled from school for endangering its residents while searching for and trying to uncover the secrets of the fabled Cursed Vaults, was somehow associated with a group of dark wizards who also sought the same thing, the higher-ups at the Ministry charged him with keeping a discreet eye on Jacob's sibling and, if possible, learn whatever this individual knew of the group. Confronted with this by Dumbledore, Tofty admitted the truth, and confessed his shame and guilt over it, and, unaware of the fact that Jacob's sibling was hiding in Dumbledore's study, left the room after he assured Dumbledore that he had accepted the mission under protest. Confronted again by the student themselves, Professor Tofty apologised and told them that he had been sincere in his desire to see them work hard and reach their full potential, and, as he departed Hogwarts, assured them that he would personally vouch for them at the Ministry should anyone there get unwarranted suspicions regarding their allegiance or intentions. At the close of the Defence Against the Dark Arts examination, Professor Tofty asked Harry Potter to cast a Patronus for an extra point. When Dolores Umbridge attempted a sneak attack on Rubeus Hagrid during the Astronomy exam, Professor Tofty tried to persuade the observing students to focus on their examination instead of the attack. However, when the Aurors\u00a0launched four Stunning Spells at Professor McGonagall, causing her to collapse, Tofty also forgot the examination and shouted in anger and shock at such a disgraceful assault. After Harry's vision of Sirius Black being tortured by Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries (actually a fake vision planted there by Voldemort to lure Harry there to retrieve a prophecy) during the History of Magic exam, Tofty escorted Harry out of the hall and told him to either return to finish what he could of the examination or visit Madam Pomfrey to get a glass of water."

A highly useful skill, invisibility could be harnessed by wizardkind, most notably by using an invisibility cloak, the Invisibility Potion or the Invisibility Spell. The protective enchantment Cave inimicum would produce an invisible boundary over the caster, concealing them from view. Wizards had also developed the Invisibility Charm, a spell used to render a target area invisible. They also developed the Invisibility Booster, a device which could turn an enchanted car, its passengers, and everything else inside invisible. Headless Hats were prank devices invented by Fred and George Weasley to make the wearer's head become invisible, in order to startle people. The books within this section discussed invisibility and were, appropriately, invisible. Some books, such as The Invisible Book of Invisibility, were invisible, raising the question how they were even read, as Flourish and Blotts could never so much as find two-hundred copies of these books.

It seems that many non-beings were more difficult to perceive for Muggles than wizards; Dementors were invisible to Muggles, Boggarts were more difficult for them to see and more easily dismissed as figments of imagination, and Poltergeists that formed in Muggle homes were usually invisible and incapable of materialising. While non-beings were not truly alive and were unable to be truly destroyed, wizards invented various spells that could drive off these spirits using positive emotions. Non-beings possessed sentience enough to have emotions, which wizards could use to negotiate with them to make them allies. Poltergeists could fear a certain authority figure of great power, as Peeves was afraid of the Bloody Baron and Albus Dumbledore, while he respected Fred and George Weasley enough to follow their order to annoy Dolores Umbridge."

As part of its abilities as a Horcrux, Tom Riddle's diary could absorb ink, and could interpret any messages written in it when it absorbed them. It could also respond to these messages in ink, though it would reabsorb the ink used after a few moments. When it was destroyed by Harry Potter in 1993, it leaked a large quantity of ink, similarly to how a human would bleed."

Fred and George Weasley of Gryffindor, Summers of Hufflepuff and S. Fawcett of Ravenclaw all used Ageing Potion to attempt to bypass this line, believing that it relied on physical age as opposed to calendar age, and were all proven wrong; they all ended up in the Hospital Wing with long, fine white beards, as witnessed by Dumbledore himself, who found the notion amusing. Despite this, the Goblet of Fire unexpectedly selected a fourth Champion: Harry Potter, who was also underage which caused great confusion to Albus Dumbledore. An age line could not be fooled or bypassed, even by a powerful potion like the Ageing Potion, as proven by Fred and George Weasley, Summers and S. Fawcett; subjects who were not at the preset age and attempted to breach the spell regardless were thrown backwards and sprouted long white beards, regardless of gender."

In August 1994, when the Weasley family visited 4 Privet Drive to pick up Harry Potter to go to the 1994 Quidditch World Cup, Fred Weasley \"accidentally\" dropped one of these toffees on the floor near Dudley Dursley which Dudley then picked up and ate. Uncle Vernon was so outraged at this that he flung several pieces of china at Arthur Weasley, while Aunt Petunia attempted to pull the object from Dudley's mouth, not realiseing what it was."

 "modifier": {
  "link": "https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Modifier",
  "summary": "A modifier was a word attached to an incantation to alter the effects of the spell that incantation was used in; for example, modifiers were frequently used to increase a spell's strength or the spell's direction. The Horribilis modifier had only ever been used in conjunction with the Shield Charm which allowed it to protect a large area almost completely from Dark magic (though admittedly it was used in conjunction with other spells). The Locomotor spell altered a target's motion in a variety of ways, depending on which modifier was used with the spell. When each was attached to a spell's inantation, they increased its strength and could potentially change the spell's appearance, Tria more so than Duo. The Revelio spell was used to reveal hidden information in various forms, depending on which modifier was used with the spell. The Solem modifier was only ever used with Lumos, which converted its harmless, all-round glow into a harsh ray of light, though it is unknown what would happen (if anything) if used in conjunction with other spells."

The twins' Extendable Ears proved very useful to Harry Potter when he was trying to listen in on the Order of the Phoenix's conversations, and trying to figure out what the Death Eaters were doing. Hermione packed a few Extendable Ears when she, Ron, and Harry went to search for Voldemort's Horcruxes in 1997. The trio used them at one point to listen to a group of Muggle-born fugitives, including Dean Thomas, that had briefly stopped outside their tent while they were on the run from horrible Snatchers.

Nott fought at several battles of the Second Wizarding War, including the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, in which he was injured. After the Battle of Hogwarts and Voldemort's final defeat, he was presumably killed or imprisoned in Azkaban. While part of the student body, he seems to have become a friend of Horace Slughorn, and as such was likely part of the Slug Club, although the professor denied this connection in later years, after Nott was revealed to have become one of the first Death Eaters. Nott fought in the First Wizarding War, and, along with Mulciber, Rosier and Dolohov, he had travelled to Hogsmeade , to \"say good luck to Voldemort, during his attempt to ask for work at Hogwarts.

Indeed, Lord Voldemort, surviving as a lingering spirit due to his Horcruxes, planned to steal the Philosopher's Stone to use the Elixir for that purpose, but was thwarted by Harry Potter in 1992. The creation of the Elixir of Life could be considered to be the success of this goal, as the potion extended life if drunk for eternity, and could bring a disembodied soul back to a physical form. Furthermore, while the Elixir extends one's lifespan, it does not cease one's body from ageing, and if using it to reach an exceptionally advanced age, it will leave them with a decrepit appearance. For example, Nicolas Flamel, who created the Philosopher's Stone, lived for a little over six-hundred and sixty years along with wife Perenelle, but took on a senile and ancient appearance, dying when he and his wife decided to have the Stone destroyed which subsequently depleted their supply of Elixir. According to Albus Dumbledore, Lord Voldemort refused to rely on the Elixir of Life for his immortality, as he would be required to drink it for eternity, and the possibility of contamination or the stone's loss would result in his death."

The most likely explanation behind the fear of the Dark Lord's name is that he and the Death Eaters caused so many atrocities that it inspired fear just mentioning his name, triggering traumatic memories of the War. Since the only individuals who weren\u2019t Death Eaters themselves who dared speak Voldemort's name were members of the Order of the Phoenix or their allies, the Taboo allowed Voldemort's followers to track down their enemies.

Theories for the lack of memory pertaining to the event range from Mass Memory Charms cast by the Goblin Liberation Front, at that time very active and attracting anarchist wizards, to the breakout of Cerebrumous Spattergroit, a more virulent sub-strain of regular Spattergroit which causes memory loss and confusion."

  "summary": "Considered to be more of a pet than a pest by the Weasleys, the ghoul was largely ignored and left to its own devices, although it did bang on the pipes and groan/howl when it felt the house was too quiet. In the summer of 1992, Harry Potter came to stay at The Burrow for the first time with the Weasleys, and was informed of the resident ghoul by Ron, whose bedroom was located under the attic, although this did not bother Harry, who instantly loved their eccentric home. During his stay, the ghoul would sometimes bang the pipes and groan and howl, whenever it felt the house was too quiet. Harry also assisted Ronald Weasley in calming down the ghoul when it was incessantly tossing pipes everywhere, a task set for him by his mother. To accomplish this, Harry and Ron sneaked into the attic by way of an open window (both to avoid Ron's angry mother and in case the ghoul had locked the attic door) and caught a number of the pipes in an old chest. Later that year, Molly threatened to set the family ghoul on the Daily Prophet reporters who had come to ask about her husband's inquiry at work because of his Flying Ford Anglia. In 1997, Ron came up with a plan to use the ghoul in his plans to assist Harry and Hermione Granger and himself search for Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes. Since he would not be at school and did not want to endanger his family, he convinced his brothers, Fred and George, to help him transfigure the ghoul so it looked more human and dress it in pyjamas."

  "summary": "On 14 September 1996, he was arrested and sent to Azkaban for being a Death Eater when he was overheard claiming to have inside information about the organisation, although in all likelihood, he was only fooling around. Stanley was born between 15 September 1974 and 13 September 1975, and possibly grew up in inner London, as he had a strong Cockney accent. As such, Stan failed to recognise Harry Potter who had just fled from 4 Privet Drive and instead believed his alias of Neville Longbottom. He was shocked when Harry nonchalantly spoke the name \"Voldemort\", and even when later meeting up with Cornelius Fudge, who confirmed Harry's true identity, Stan continued to refer Harry as \"Neville\" for the rest of that trip. Stan attended the 1994 Quidditch World Cup, and after the match, Stan and several others were witnessed by Harry and Ron Weasley trying to chat up a group of Veela, with Stan making the outrageous and false comment of him being \"about to be made the youngest Minister for Magic ever\", in an effort to impress them. Stan met Harry once again when he, along with Ron and his siblings were being transported by the Knight Bus back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in January 1996. Stan, this time, realised who Harry was, though made the mistake of blurting out his name to his friend, the driver, Ernie Prang. Harry's primary bodyguard; the expertly-disguised Auror Nymphadora Tonks, threatened to \"curse Stan into oblivion\" if he did it again, as they were concerned for Harry's security. Stan, true to his vain nature, tried to impress his friends at a local pub by making the statement that he had inside knowledge of the Death Eaters' plans."

Many times throughout the 1990s, this room was shared between Ron and his best friend Harry Potter during his stays at the house. A small hatch in the ceiling outside this room opens to reveal a ladder that allows access to the attic, a dark, musty place where the Weasley family ghoul lives. The ghoul spent some time in Ron's room from 1997 to 1998, when Ron, Harry, and their other best friend Hermione Granger set off on their Horcrux hunt. By 1992, when Ron was twelve, this room was small enough for Harry Potter, a smaller boy, to have his head almost touch the sloping ceiling. Everything in the room was coloured the orange hue used by the Chudley Cannons Quidditch team, giving the room the impression of walking into a furnace. The wallpaper was notably shabby and covered nearly completely with posters of said team, and a variety of peculiar objects littered the area: spell books, comics about The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle, quidditch books, Ron's magic wand, and a tank of frog spawn. Across from the doorway, which was labelled RONALD'S ROOM, was a small window, which offered a generous view of the family garden. Ron expressed his dissatisfaction with his room and complained about its size, which was even smaller than the one Harry had been given by the neglectful Dursley family."

After Scabbers, Ron's old pet rat, disappeared (having been found out to be Peter Pettigrew), Sirius Black, who felt partly responsible for Ron's loss of a pet, sent him Pigwidgeon (nicknamed \"Pig\"). Upon receiving the owl, Ron (to the surprise of Harry and Hermione) actually let Crookshanks sniff him to check if he really was an owl. Pigwidgeon was named by Ginny Weasley, because she thought the name was cute. Though Ron tried to change it, the owl would not answer to another name. Pigwidgeon was exceedingly hyper, loud, bothersome, very small, and had been known to be a show off for other people (this, however, annoyed other owls, forcing Ron to keep him in his room)."

The ship was described as having\u00a0a strange, skeletal look, and appeared to be similar to a 16th century Spanish galleon, possessing a quarterdeck and forecastle. In 1994, the Durmstrang delegation arrived with their candidates on board of the ship. During their stay at Hogwarts, the ship was anchored in the Black Lake in front of Hogwarts Castle. At the end of the Tournament, the Durmstrang students boarded their ship and sailed back to Durmstrang. In 1994, Viktor Krum was seen diving off the ship and into the lake by Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley. Despite being used as a method of transportation by Durmstrang, travelling by underwater ship was a breach of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy."

One day, Raczidian noticed a beautiful girl from the village, Eliana, while she was collecting berries in the woods. At first, they succeeded in holding at bay the Dementors that Raczidian unleashed upon them with the combined might of their Patronuses, but gradually the sheer number of foes began to overwhelm them. Just when it looked as if all hope was lost, however, Illyius \u2014 a shy, young orphan who had been told to sit out the battle because the village elders thought his Patronus was too feeble to be of any use \u2014 cast the Patronus Charm. Enraged that something so small should thwart him, Raczidian decided to enter the fray himself and attempted to summon a Patronus to ward off Illyius's mouse. However, he failed to remember that only the pure of heart can produce a Patronus, and thus for the first time in history, it was revealed what happens when a competent but unworthy wizard or witch attempts the spell."

After attacking three male Muggles who assaulted Ariana, he was sentenced to imprisonment in Azkaban. Many years later, his eldest son became the longest and most noted Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was considered by some as the greatest wizard of all time. In his later life, he married a Muggle-born witch named Kendra with whom he had three children: Albus (who bore the same as his second name), Aberforth, and Ariana. At the age of six, Percival's daughter Ariana was assaulted by three Muggle boys. Percival, in a fit of vengeful rage, attacked her assailants. This was largely due to his fear that if the Ministry found out about his daughter's delicate condition, they would send her to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries for the rest of her life, effectively locking her away permanently as a hazard to the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy."

 "morsmordre": {

  "summary": "Morsmordre was the incantation of a dark charm used to conjure the image of the Dark Mark, the skull-and-serpent sign used by Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters, in the sky. After Voldemort's first defeat, the Mark was no longer seen since the method for casting it was known only to the innermost circle of Death Eaters. If these individuals had escaped death or Azkaban, they had done so by lying about their membership in the organisation, and therefore casting the spell would have been something of a give-away. His motive in casting this spell was primarily to terrify the former Death Eaters, as opposed to the other spectators. This caused a widespread panic, as seeing the sign after 14 years made people think Voldemort has returned, and Death Eaters feared the possibility of Voldemort's return more than the civilians due to their disloyalty to the Dark Lord may bring retributions. After it was remembered that only a former Death Eater would have had the knowledge to cast the spell, both Winky along with Harry, Ron and Hermione were cleared of any involvement. Voldemort later used his knowledge of this event to contradict Lucius Malfoy's claim that he was on the alert for any sign of Voldemort's return, and would have immediately rejoined him, upon his return at the Little Hangleton graveyard. Igor Karkaroff was killed in 1996 by Death Eaters for betraying Lord Voldemort, and the Dark Mark was cast over the shack in which his body was found."

In later years, the surviving members of Dumbledore's Army would keep their coins, regarding them as badges of honour.

At that time, Ron Weasley and Hermione attempted to summon help during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, but only Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood responded, as they were especially vigilant members.

By the summer of 1997, Lucius Malfoy and many other Death Eaters had escaped Azkaban prison, and the Dark Lord had made the Malfoys' home his headquarters. While the Malfoys were very uncomfortable with this, Bellatrix Lestrange, Lucius's sister-in-law, who also resided there, claimed there could be \"no higher pleasure\" than having Lord Voldemort stay with them. Shortly before Harry Potter's seventeenth birthday, Severus Snape and Corban Yaxley entered Malfoy Manor and found Voldemort sitting at a table with gathered Death Eaters. Snape then informed Voldemort that the Order of the Phoenix was moving Harry Potter from the Dursley home to a secret location the following Saturday, four days before his birthday, at sunset. Yaxley discussed how it would be easier to take over the Ministry with Thicknesse under their control, as he had regular contact with the Minister and the other department Heads, the latter which he could be made to be brought under the Imperius curse to do the Death Eaters' bidding and help bring down the Ministry. The resulting plans would lead to Voldemort's take-over of the Ministry, using Thicknesse as a puppet Minister for Magic, and the Battle of the Seven Potters. After the Priori Incantatem effect during the Duel in Little Hangleton, Voldemort knew that he would need a different wand to use against Harry as his wand and Harry's shared the same wand core, a Phoenix tail feather from Fawkes."

Death felt cheated that the three brothers had outsmarted him and had not drowned in the river, as many others had. The eldest went first, and being a belligerent man he asked for a wand that would defeat all others. Death went to a nearby elder tree and created a wand from its wood, which he handed to the eldest brother. The second brother, who wanted to humiliate Death even further, asked for an object that would recall the dead and was given the Resurrection Stone. Later, the three brothers separated."

In September 1993, the Dementor was among the Dementors of Azkaban dispatched to Hogwarts by the Ministry of Magic to guard it against a possible attack by Sirius Black. Eventually, the Dementor found its way to the compartment housing Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger and a then-slumbering Professor Remus Lupin. It slid the compartment's door aside and stood in the doorway, illuminated by the light of a now-awake Lupin's Hand-held flames. The Dementor then surveyed the compartment, creating an unhappy and freezing environment, feeding on human happiness and creating feelings of depression and despair in any person in close proximity to it. As a result, Harry Potter, noted for his particularly bad reaction to a Dementor's presence, began to relive the night he heard his parents murdered by Voldemort. Harry fainted and fell out of his seat, prompting Lupin to step forward and tell the Dementor that Sirius Black was obviously not in their compartment, and that it must leave. The Dementor refused to comply, apparently eager to keep feeding on Harry Potter; realising it would get nowhere by bargaining with it, Lupin cast a non-corporeal Patronus Charm to drive the Dementor away, and the Dementor withdrew."

The King appointed him as Grand Sorcerer in Chief, the King's Private Magic Master, so he could teach him his \"magic\". The King wanted to learn how to use magic, so he had proclamations read in every village across the country, looking for someone with magical abilities to teach him. No real wizards or witches responded, due to the King's earlier decree that all wizards and witches be hunted down and killed by the Brigade of Witch-Hunters. He took the post as the King's Magic Master for purely selfish reasons of gaining money, rubies, a silver chalice and fame. One day, while the King and the Charlatan were practising waving their twigs and chanting meaningless rhymes, they heard Babbitty cackling hysterically from her cottage. This enraged the King, who demanded that the Charlatan perform in front of his subjects to show off his new abilities. The Charlatan attempted to back out by saying he had to go out of town, and could not help him, but the King threatened to send the Brigade after him. And if he stayed, and anyone ridiculed the King, the Charlatan's head would be cut off. The Charlatan headed to Babbitty's house, from where she had been spying on the King and the Charlatan, and found out that she was a real witch."

Later on in her career in 1938, Mrs Cole was visited by Albus Dumbledore, who had come to tell her that the late Merope Gaunts's eleven-year-old son, Tom Marvolo Riddle, had been accepted into Hogwarts School.

The orphanage was built and operational sometime before 31 December, 1926, when the pregnant witch Merope Riddle came to the orphanage, shortly after her husband Tom Riddle Snr abandoned her. The orphanage took care of the newborn, without knowing his magical heritage, though unpleasant incidents occurred around him without any solid evidence to condemn the young Tom. Tom has no sentimental attachments for the orphanage, as the staff rarely gave him parental guidance due to his independent nature (as he rarely cried even in his infancy), and he would constantly terrorise his fellow orphans due to his uniqueness compared to them; raised without parental love and among people who are different from him, he found it impossible to bond with them. On one occasion he defensively accused Mrs Cole of insanity without any hesitation when he thought she was going to send him to an asylum for his actions, while Cole herself expressed her joy that he would be gone from the orphanage during his studies abroad. Throughout his seven years of education, Tom deeply wished to avoid returning to Wool's Orphanage for the summers, as he even made a special request to the then-headmaster Armando Dippet to remain in school during the holidays. In his sixth year's summer vacation in 1943, Tom departed from the facility to head towards Little Hangleton to confront his Muggle father before returning. Upon graduating and becoming a legal adult, Riddle departed from Wool's Orphanage forever, beginning his career at Borgin and Burkes and down the path to becoming the most feared dark wizard known. During their search for Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley investigated the possibility that he had hidden one of them in the orphanage, even though Harry highly doubted that they would find one there, since Voldemort's Muggle heritage would be something that he would not want to remember."

Ms. Gambol rose to the office of Minister for Magic in 1827 and proved to be effective in the solution of the problem of how to transport hundreds of students to and from Hogwarts Castle without attracting the Muggles' attention. However, Portkeys proved not to be the ideal solution to the problem of school transportation (up to a third of students would fail to arrive every year, as well as many students were prone to Portkey-sickness). A return to the unregulated travel of the past was impossible, as well as other magical routes into the school (like the usage of Floo Powder) were strongly resisted by successive Headmasters, who were concerned the security of the Castle would be breached. Three years into her time in office, in 1830, Minister Gambol made a daring and controversial suggestion to solve the problem: intrigued by the Muggle technology, the Minister saw the potential of using a train as a secure and comfortable alternative to Portkeys. Where the locomotive was actually obtained from remains unknown, but there are classified files at the Ministry of Magic pertaining to a large-scale operation involving one hundred and sixty-seven Memory Charms, as well as the biggest Concealment Charm ever performed in Britain. The morning after this operation, the residents of Hogsmeade awoke to find a railway station that had not been there previously and Muggle railway employees in Crewe had the feeling they had misplaced something, which stayed with them for the rest of the year."

Once Hobart realised the true nature of the Levitation Charm, he scheduled another demonstration, which went a lot better until as a grand finale he levitated off the Chief Warlock's hat, only for it to be revealed the Chief Warlock was also wearing a wig. Albus Dumbledore had held this title since at least 1988, until 1995 when a discrediting campaign that the British Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet carried out that year caused him to lose the position. Given that the Wizengamot was presided over by the Minister for Magic in the disciplinary of Harry Potter in 1995, the period in which Dumbledore had lost this title, Cornelius Fudge had seemingly taken on the role of Chief Warlock himself."

In 1995, following helping to thwart an attack on Harry, Ron and Hermione Granger, Fred Weasley casually suggested a game of Exploding Snap, pulling out of a pack of cards, and the group enjoyed several games when Harry decided in the middle of the fifth game to ask him and George who it was they had been blackmailing.

  "summary": "Walters was born as Julia Mary Walters in Smethwick, West Midlands, the daughter of Mary Bridget (n\u00e9e O'Brien), a postal clerk of Irish Catholic extraction, and Thomas Walters, a builder and decorator. Walters attended Holly Lodge Grammar School for Girls on Holly Lane in Smethwick, although was asked to leave at the end of her lower sixth due to her 'high jinks'. Deciding to give up her nursing career to become an actress and live with her boyfriend in Manchester, she studied English and Drama at Manchester Polytechnic (now Manchester Metropolitan University) with Pete Postlethwaite and pursuing a performance career. In an interview with Alison Oddey, Walters said about her early schooling: \"I was never going to be academic, so  suggested that I try teaching or nursing [...] I'd been asked to leave school, so I thought I'd better do it\". Walters first achieved fame as the occasional partner of comedienne Victoria Wood, whom she had met in Manchester. The two first worked together in the 1978 theatre revue In At The Death, followed by the television adaptation of Wood's play Talent. The Bafta-winning BBC follow-up, Victoria Wood As Seen On TV, featured one of Walters' best-known roles, Mrs Overall in Wood's spoof soap opera, Acorn Antiques (she later appeared in the musical version, and received an Olivier Award nomination for her efforts). Before making her London stage debut in Educating Rita, Walters had worked in regional theatre (including the Everyman Theatre, Liverpool), stand-up comedy and cabaret. Her first serious acting role on TV was in the classic Boys from the Blackstuff in 1982, and she broke into films with her Academy Award-nominated, BAFTA Best Actress award-winning and Golden Globe Award Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical/Comedy award-winning performance opposite Michael Caine in Educating Rita (1983), a role she had created on the West End stage. In 1991 she starred opposite Liza Minnelli in \"Stepping Out\" and had a one-off television special, Julie Walters and Friends, which featured writing contributions from Victoria Wood and Alan Bennett."

 "afterlife": {

It appears that the afterlife is something that most of the magical community believes in, as there are numerous examples of it. According to various ideas about the afterlife, the essential aspect of the individual that lives on after death may be some partial element, or the entire soul or spirit, of an individual, which carries with it and may confer personal identity or, on the contrary, may not, as in Indian nirvana. Belief in an afterlife, which may be naturalistic or supernatural, is in contrast to the belief in oblivion after death. The afterlife in the wizarding world appeared to be heavily influenced by the state of an individual's soul. For example, with the destruction of all of Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes his broken and mangled soul was forced to exist in its stunted form in limbo. A ghost is someone who chose to remain in the world of the living after death, mostly due to fear of the unknown."

Despite siding with Grindelwald when he rose to power throughout the wizarding world, Krall was conflicted and disillusioned with his decision, to an extent.

Three months later, Abernathy travelled with Grindelwald and other acolytes to Paris, intending to find Credence Barebone and to spread word of their cause. Abernathy took part in the murdering of a Non-Magical family in Paris with his fellow acolytes, which allowed them to take over the now unoccupied home as a safe haven and base for them.

Once the Malfoys left, Borgin showed signs of disliking and resenting Malfoy, thinking that the objects Malfoy had brought him was only a small piece of what Malfoy was hiding in his mansion. In 1996, Draco Malfoy came to Borgin to reserve the Vanishing Cabinet, which he planned to use to smuggle Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Borgin was not sure how this would be possible without having the cabinet with him, but became much more cooperative when Draco showed him his Dark Mark and threatened to send Fenrir Greyback on regular checks if he would not succeed.
